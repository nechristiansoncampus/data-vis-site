10/17/2020,Victor Damptey,10/16/2020,David,"Had a time with him and James, spent most of the time just chatting about random things, James had to leave early so in the last 10 minutes or so I asked about the time with Scott Finnie after IPMM, he liked the time but I didn't perceive that it really touched or affected him in anyway too deeply. We can continue to pray for Victor, sometimes it's hard to gauge where he is with the Lord, at times it seems he has quite a dutiful and religious relationship with Him."
10/17/2020,James Nguyen,10/16/2020,David,"Time with James and Victor, not much spiritual content when James was with us. James and Victor are both very very busy. ROTC on top of school seems to be a lot for James, he said ROTC just assigned him two more projects to work on."
10/17/2020,Jonas Cameron,10/17/2020,David,"Caught up and he asked how I was doing so I shared a bit about my conversation with my brother earlier in the week which led to him talking about his family a bit, it was good to open to one another and it was very human and sweet. Read Luke 9 and had a lot of fellowship about the last verses about leaving the dead father and not looking backwards while plowing. Shared about true sanctification coming from being filled with God not outward effort to remove things from our lives. The outward effort is just a facilitation for more conversations with the Lord. He also shared about how we need revelation from God to perceive what God is saying. Strengthened and confirmed his speaking with Eph 1:17 and Eph 3:2-3."
10/17/2020,Adun Obisesan,10/17/2020,Cassia (trainee),"spent first half catching up and second half reading Mark 1 and listening to the daily manna podcast. Talked a little about retreat, taught her freight train song which she really liked. Talked about the similarities/differences between the Gospels and how the Lord came as a slave to serve us. she made a remark about how it would be nice to go to a Bible school!! (plans are to apply to grad school)"
10/17/2020,Ben Gao,02/16/2020,"Marc, Phil","We read Luke 9 and talked about how the Lord wants us to give the ones around us food (v13) and that to follow the Lord is not very hard (and the Christian life), but impossible, but that we can be honest with Lord and just invite him into our situation.  We prayed at the end, let the Lord into our all situation and decisions."
10/22/2020,Garrett Robinson,10/19/2020,David,Read Mark 3 and listened to daily manna and then had some fellowship
10/22/2020,Daniel Lee,10/20/2020,David,Caught up and had some fellowship over Luke 21 specifically over the woman who cast in two lepta out of her lack. What matters to Lord is how much we value Him not how much we give.
10/22/2020,Steven Liu,10/21/2020,David,Fellowshipped about 1 Cor 13 about love being a person and how the source of all that we do in the Christian life should be love and our love for the Lord. Then fellowshipped about how the development of love is 1 Cor 14 in which we gather with the believers in love to minister Christ to one another. It's easy to live a Christian life without meeting with others and it's easy to live a Christian life without speaking out what we enjoy of Christ but both are so crucial to a healthy Christian life.
10/22/2020,Travis Hank,10/22/2020,David,"Did a little review of Bible study and talked about how come heat and pressure produce value in the spiritual realm, because it teaches us how to access God as our supply and strength. Then fellowshipped about the verse of the day from YouVersion, talking about the Lord as our refuge and shield, and hoping in His word. Very applicable to Travis because he's super busy with job search, research, classes, family stuff, and dating. Ended with some prayer for our families and for Travis's full plate of things."
10/22/2020,Renbin Liu,10/22/2020,David ,Phil / David. We spent some time catching up then got into 2 Tim 3. We brought up the matter of breathing in the Word and how we need to keep breathing Him throughout the day. What was really encouraging to us was when we pray read a verse together. It was watering to see Renbin touch the Word with his spirit!!
10/25/2020,Sophia Fang,10/22/2020,Laura,"Spent time catching up and praying together. We read Ministry Digest, vol 1, chapter 3 on the translation of the Bible."

10/25/2020,Jessica Wang,10/22/2020,"Laura, Zoya",Spent some time catching up & introductions. Read Mark 6 together and spent some time talking about the Lord's care for us and through us. She got very excited when we told her about the Daily Manna podcasts and downloaded the app.
10/25/2020,Eugenia Feng,10/22/2020,Laura,"Read Mark 6 together and then listened to the Daily Manna podcast. We had some fellowship about ""green grass"" - following the Lord and some very sweet prayer together at the end."
10/27/2020,Jonas Cameron,10/27/2020,David,"Fellowshipped over Zech which led to Revelation, talked about the lampstand in Zech and the 7 lampstands in Rev 1-3. Proposed reading ""The Orthodoxy of the Church"" and he was interested so he ordered a copy off Amazon and we're gonna start with chapter 1 this week."

10/29/2020,Debbie Zhuang,10/23/2020,Cassia (FTTA),"caught up with Debbie Zhuang, prayed for upcoming appointment with student (update - did not end up happening). Student has connections to others from her high school who are in the church life or meeting with the club on their campus."
10/29/2020,Travis Hank,10/29/2020,David,Talked about his job search and he's a bit frustrated with how the interview process has been for some of the companies he is hoping for. Was supposed to fellowship over Mere Christianity today but he forgot to read in the midst of his busyness. He did read the Bible study material from last night that I sent him though so we had some fellowship over that. He was pretty burnt out from the week though so we didn't fellowship too much. End with some prayer.
10/29/2020,Doris Fu,10/29/2020,Cassia (FTTA),"called Doris, caught up some and read Week 1 Day 1 from Holy Word for Morning Revival: Topics for New Believers, Vol. 1. Had some questions on 1 John 5:13, and what it means to pass out of death into life. Expounded on 1 John from the verses beforehand, and meaning of eternal life. She seemed to be responsive about 1 John but couldn't really tell what her reaction was to the latter topic. Time was a bit short, but we plan to call again next week."

11/3/2020,Jonas Cameron,11/03/2020,David,"Fellowshipped over the first chapter of ""The Orthodoxy of the Church"" very positive fellowship, talking about the abnormality of the church, how Satan will use anything to lead people away from God's will including seemingly godly men and speaking, how we can only trust in the word of God and the Lord's appearing to us, and also spoke concerning objective and subjective righteousness."
11/3/2020,Sophia Fang,10/29/2020,Laura,We just got together (in person) and had lunch together. We talked about how she's a bit discouraged that the freshmen are not as involved or interested.
11/3/2020,Katia Pendowski,10/29/2020,"Lisa, Laura","read and listened to the podcast on Mark 12 - vv.19-26 answered a question that she had. Then, we spent some time to answer the question: ""What does it mean to love the Lord with our WHOLE heart, soul, mind, and strength?"""
11/3/2020,Jessica Wang,10/29/2020,"Laura, Zoya",read Mark 12. She's been reading and listening to the podcasts. Spent time talking about how we can love the Lord more - spend time!
11/3/2020,Eugenia Feng,10/29/2020,Laura,"read Mark 12 together. Talked about the poor woman and 2 lepta - it's a priority (like the illustration with the rocks in the jar that she saw in Rooted this summer). Then, we prayed together. Our prayer was very sweet."
11/3/2020,Helen Yang,11/02/2020,Laura,"(with Debbie Zhuang!) I met her for the first time, and we caught up. We talked about how she wants to come back to campus next semester (and live in Next House). Read Mark 15 together - talked about the Lord's great love for us to save us!"

11/5/2020,Travis Hank,11/05/2020,David,"Shorter call today, discussed briefly the first two chapters of Mere Christianity but it was quite philosophical and not very scriptural, luckily the main points very much related to the previous night's Bible study on the tree of life vs the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Then talked about our days and had some prayer for his continued job search. Mentioned he would try to make IPMM this Saturday."
11/5/2020,Renbin Liu,11/05/2020,David,With Phil. Had some fellowship over Hebrews 8 about the new covenant inscribed in our hearts. Talked about our subjective vs. objective knowing of Him which led to more sharing from previous chapters of Hebrews. Invited Renbin to the gospel meeting this Saturday.
11/6/2020,Victor Damptey,11/06/2020,David,"With James, chatted and caught up, then read Luke 3 and had some fellowship, talked about being offspring of vipers and how we had the sin nature that not only causes us to do bad things but mainly causes us to be independent of God. Also talked about why the Lord needed to be baptized. At the end mentioned the IPMM and the gospel burden and we prayed for the IPMM. They should they would try to make it but may be too busy."
11/6/2020,James Nguyen,11/06/2020,David,"With Victor D, see above"
11/6/2020,James Nguyen,11/06/2020,David,"With Victor D, see above"
11/7/2020,Jonas Cameron,11/07/2020,David,"Ch 2 of Orthodoxy of the Church, talked about how Christ views the church from eternity, so though it is degraded today in His eyes the church is glorious. Also mentioned that the church is dirty right now but is being washed in the water of the word (the blood and the water in the word pointing to objective and subjective righteousness). Then spent a long time talking about Nicolaitans and the clergy laity system, how it is the tendency of our fallen man to separate into these two categories, the loud and active ones become clergy and the silent timid ones become laity and how both types of people are at fault. We need to hate our tendency and recognize the works of the Nicolaitans. Eventually the works of the Nicolaitans become a teaching, institutionalizing the dormancy of some and the overfunctioning of others. Referenced 1 Cor 14 how when the believers gather together each one has and every one should open their mouth to pray or speak. When this happens unbelievers in our midst will fall down and confess surely God is among you. 

Jonas said (slightly paraphrased), ""I hope God gives me such a vision of the church, I envision people just sitting in a circle praying and speaking. Even the set up of a normal congregation (pews and a podium) is against what we see here. Right now the church is confused and steeped in the tradition of man. I pray the Lord would guide me back to His original intention and make me an overcomer. Overcoming is not just overcoming sin and unrighteousness though those things are included, it is to overcome the confusion in the church to be brought back to God's original intention."""
11/9/2020,Doris Fu,11/05/2020,Cassia (FTTA),"Had time with Doris to read from HWMR: Topics for New Believers, Vol. 1, Week 1 Day 2 on the assurance of salvation. She asked two questions along the lines of the  meaning of salvation if other belief systems have their own interpretation of being ""saved"", and what is the difference among the religions if they all aspire to do good. Responded with Ecclesiastes 3:11, and what God's true intention is for man and the picture of the tree of life, and my experience of calling on the Lord's name in our house. Pray that the Lord would infuse her with faith and call on the Lord Jesus!"
11/9/2020,Debbie Zhuang,11/06/2020,Cassia (FTTA),"quickly caught up with Debbie, shared some enjoyment from the training on being a vessel of God. Prayed along those lines and in general for our week."
11/9/2020,Sophia Fang,11/05/2020,Laura,"We prayed together for the IPMM, for Hanna, Gabby, and Ashley. Then, we read the first section of the booklet, ""the Bible"". "
11/9/2020,Katia Pendowski,11/05/2020,"Lisa, Laura",We read and listened to the podcast on Luke 2 - she was impressed with Mary's response.
11/9/2020,Jessica Wang,11/05/2020,"Laura, Zoya","We read Luke 2 together - she was impressed that ""salvation is a Person!"""
11/9/2020,Helen Yang,11/09/2020,Laura,"(with DEBBIE!)  We spent time talking Luke 5 together - talked about how the Lord knows what's in our hearts, how the Lord eats with sinners, and how we need Christian friends to help us come to the Lord."
11/11/2020,Daniel Lee,11/10/2020,David,"Chatted for a while then read 2 Kings 2 because his pastor gave a sermon about Elisha receiving a double portion of Elijah's spirit. Talked about how Elisha staying with Elijah staying with despite the opposition of others and Elijah's telling him to leave him is similar to Ruth and Naomi and he brought up Jacob's not letting the Lord go until He blessed him. Then connected it to 2 Kings 4 where the flowing of oil, the Spirit is dependent on the number of empty vessels. The Spirit is always ready to fill but there may be no room in us for Him to come in so we need to first pray Lord empty me, then Lord fill me."
11/12/2020,Travis Hank,11/12/2020,David,Caught up and then discussed chapter 3 of Mere Christianity briefly which led to me sharing it bit from my Bible reading in Exodus about how the altar built to worship God should not use hewn stones signifying the work of natural man polluting the worship of God. We had some fellowship along those lines for a bit and then ended with some prayer.
11/12/2020,Steven Liu,11/12/2020,David,"Steven had a busy week so hasn't been able to do his individual Bible reading but we read 2 Cor 1 together and had some good fellowship about being ministers of Christ and the new covenant. We can comfort those with the comfort we receive from God, similarly we can only give the Christ that we have experienced to others. In his words, ""Our purpose is to be vehicles of Christ."" He was also shepherding to see that all our difficult experience have the purpose of filling of us with more Christ to give to others."
11/12/2020,Renbin Liu,11/12/2020,David,Caught up and prayed for his job search. Read Hebrew 12:1-13 and had fellowship on how the purpose of discipline is to cause us to partake more of God's holiness. Then talked about how the Christian life is a race and we run it by looking away unto Jesus who is the Author of our faith. We can only have faith by looking at the Lord the race is a race of faith. Brought in the example of Peter walking on water. Then also read the footnote on the immense magnet and shared about the Lord's attracting beauty and our unique need being to see the Lord's majesty more and more everyday.
11/16/2020,Doris Fu,11/16/2020,Cassia (FTTA),"Had a good time with Doris talking a little about school and graduation plans. Might be starting her Meng early but is having difficulty finding a lab right now. Read Week 1, Day 3 of HWMR Topics for New Believers, on twelve items demonstrating the security of salvation. She asked about the section on God's unchallengeable justification. Shared with her about Christ being our righteousness when he died for our sins on the cross. Was thinking of giving her some verses to read from Romans 3-5, have yet to do so. She felt the reading was a little packed so I just encouraged her to just keep going and things would get clearer with repetition."
11/16/2020,Debbie Zhuang,11/16/2020,Cassia (FTTA),brief conversation and prayer with Debbie. Still very busy (deadlines were approaching this weekend). She is helping coordinate a blending time with the students from GBA and SoCal with 1-2 college/alum from here. Ended our time with prayer.
11/16/2020,Abraham Park,11/13/2020,David,"Caught up and then read Luke 9 and had some fellowship, ended with a song and calling on the Lord"
11/16/2020,Adun Obisesan,11/14/2020,"Cassia, Zoya (FTTA)","Caught up and read Luke 9 (prayed at the beginning) and listened to the podcast. We shared Christ being the jubilee, and how the disciples and now us can be those proclaiming the jubilee. Talked about when the Lord went to the Mount and was transfigured. Adun Obisesan talked about how people mistakenly put Jesus on the same level as Elijah and Moses. We shared how Peter still made the mistake after seeing the revelation of Jesus as the Christ., but the Lord always brought His disciples with Him wherever He went. Adun Obisesan mentioned how she was convicted by vs. 57-62 about giving things up to follow the Lord. Brought up Matthew 6:33 about seeking first His kingdom, and all the other things would be added to us."
11/17/2020,Garrett Robinson,11/17/2020,David,"Chatted and learned about his family, he has a huge family. Then read Luke 11 and had some fellowship about the kingdom of God and the kingdom of Satan. Then took the opportunity to introduce the three parts of man to him, ran out of time so we will continue next Monday."
11/17/2020,Sophia Fang,11/12/2020,Laura,"Had a short call (maybe 20 minutes). Prayed a little and then finished reading the small booklet, ""The Bible""."
11/17/2020,Katia Pendowski,11/12/2020,"Lisa, Laura",We read and listened to the podcast on Luke 8. We talked a little about the disciples while the Lord was sleeping in the boat. Our faith (even in particularly distressing and dangerous times) just comes from the Lord's Word. Katia didn't really say much.
11/17/2020,Jessica Wang,11/12/2020,"Laura, Zoya","Read Luke 8 together. Spent some time talking about the condition of our heart to let the Word be planted and grow in our heart. How we can cooperate with the Lord (praying, confessing, asking) for the rocks in our heart to be dug out and the thorns to be dealt with so they don't choke the seed growing."
11/17/2020,Sophia Fang,11/14/2020,Laura,"SERVING YP - Sophia and I served during the YP meeting in Cambridge on LD (11/15) morning. We had a call to pray, get into the material, pull some significant verses, and fellowship for our time together. We spent over an hour praying and fellowshipping in preparation of our service."
11/17/2020,Helen Yang,11/16/2020,Laura,"(with DEBBIE!) We caught up (talked about the weather in Boston and how to stay warm - Helen is planning to come to be on campus next semester). We then read Luke 11 together and just shared that no matter what our condition or situation is in our life with the Lord, we can keep our eyes on Him and He is in us as the light (vv. 34-35), and, how we can always ask Him! When we ask, He gives us good things - He gives us the Spirit (v.13)."
11/19/2020,Doris Fu,11/19/2020,Cassia (FTTA),"Talked to Doris about school and read HWMR Week 1 Day 4  (continuation of security of salvation). After reading she said (lightheartedly) that doesn't really think about eternal perishing in her daily life. I told her that didn't really either but shared that at least we can have the assurance of never perishing since we've been saved and are in an eternal relationship with God (from the reading), and the other end would be the lake of fire. Told her that we would get into more reading about Him wanting to be our life now, so we're not just waiting for the future. She seemed happy when we ended."
11/19/2020,Renbin Liu,11/19/2020,Phil,"Caught up about Renbin’s job search and Thanksgiving plans then read James 5. We had some good fellowship about the overall “flavor” of James after finishing the book. Brought out the practicality of James for the Christian life but somehow still falling short of a life for fully for God’s economy. Had some fellowship about some portions of Hebrews chapter 8 and 12 we went over in the previous weeks, concerning the new covenant over the old and tied it back to what we read in James. It was encouraging to hear that he used something we covered in Hebrews to speak a timely word to a friend. Our fellowship led to Renbin bringing up his struggle concerning prayer. He mentioned that he seemed to be missing the connection with the Lord in his prayer, being distracted by different things, and having the conversation cut off at times. Had some good fellowship about what prayer is and how to maintain that connection with the Lord as well as dealing with distracting thoughts. Suggested Lessons on Prayer book, also brought up again how the Lord will often speak to us through His Word. Prayed about what the Lord has done in Renbin this semester and for his job search / post graduation plans. Lord, thank you for Renbin’s desire to know you more in prayer and in the Word! Keep growing in Renbin!"
11/20/2020,Daniel Lee,11/17/2020,David,"Caught up and talked about holiday plans and the pandemic, then had some fellowship over Prov 20:24, 27 about not knowing our own way but trusting the Lord and also knowing our inward parts by touching the Lord in our spirit"
11/20/2020,Daniel Lee,11/17/2020,David,"Caught up and talked about holiday plans and the pandemic, then had some fellowship over Prov 20:24, 27 about not knowing our own way but trusting the Lord and also knowing our inward parts by touching the Lord in our spirit"
11/20/2020,Steven Liu,11/18/2020,"David, Victor","Caught up and chatted about holiday plans, then read 2 Cor 2 and had some good fellowship over doing things in the person of Christ, according to the index of His eyes. How we should do things looking at the Lord's face and according to His feeling. Then we also fellowshipped about being a fragrance of Christ and how we should bear the fragrance of Christ. Ended by pray-reading 2 Cor 2:15"
11/22/2020,Travis Hank,11/22/2020,David,"Caught up and prayed briefly for his job search, then he shared how he enjoyed the verse of the day, Heb 13:5 and I shared 1 Tim 6:17 with him."
11/22/2020,Jonas Cameron,11/21/2020,David,"Fellowshipped over ch 3 of Orthodoxy of the Church, talked about our need as Christians to know and live in resurrection. Then had a lot of fellowship about Judaism negatively effectively the church. He was a bit bothered about the fact that Brother Nee said in the church there is no law and the fact that he seems to ignore the fact that the NT calls us the real Jews, the sons of Abraham but through some fellowship we really enjoyed the fact that inwardly we are Jews and that we get to enjoy the realities of the things that outward Jews enjoyed. Had in depth fellowship about the law of life, the physical temple vs the house to house daily church life, also mentioned the blessing of Abraham being the promise of the Spirit and of course we already covered clergy-laity."
11/23/2020,Adun Obisesan,11/22/2020,Cassia (FTTA),"Adun Obisesan flew home this past Saturday to Columbus, OH, and will be there for the rest of the school year. Caught up with her school/post-graduation plans. Read Luke 15 and listened to the podcast, fellowshipped about the items in the podcast (Triune God in Luke 15, how the other son in the parable signifies Pharisees and also us). She also talked about her friend that she talked to last week about the Lord. She testified that she felt distracted from God last week, but then the Lord gave her an opportunity to share with her friend on Wednesday. She confessed to the Lord that she was just an ""imperfect messenger"" preaching the perfect Word. We prayed for one another and for her friend. She also requested for prayer for her academics - she feels less motivated, perhaps by a multitude of factors, but she also realizes her relationship with God has been deepening. Shared some of my experiences in senior year as an encouragement. Oh Lord, keep gaining Adun Obisesan and whatever You desire in her, and connect her with the saints!!"
11/30/2020,Doris Fu,11/30/2020,Cassia (FTTA),"had two times with Doris (11/26, 11/30)- the first time just caught up about her school, currently trying to find funding/lab for her Meng, which she plans to start next semester. Today we read the portion that we weren't able to get to on Thursday on baptism! She seemed to be in agreement when we were reading, but was still a little confused afterwards. I expounded more on the section about believing (inward salvation) versus baptism (outward affirmation). She asked how baptism is carried out (ex. in a swimming pool) and if you need to have position in the church to baptize someone. I said not really, as long as they are a believer, and it is usually someone older. She seemed to have a desire to be baptized, and I was thinking about how it could be possible if there were some saints in New York (but COVID). She said though that she will be in Cambridge by February 1, and I told her I'd also be back very close to then. We can pray for the Lord to release her baptism, and she would remain open and her thoughts would be guarded in Christ!! Lord, release Doris's baptism and all of the logistics!"
12/2/2020,Garrett Robinson,11/30/2020,David,"Read Luke 23 and listened to daily manna, had some fellowship about how the Lord was falsely accused but didn't vindicate Himself. Also fellowshipped briefly over the seven statuses Christ had in his death from the podcast."
12/2/2020,Daniel Lee,12/01/2020,David,"Shorter time because he's busy this week, but he shared how he enjoyed Phil 4:6 from a sermon he listened to earlier in the week and how he shouldn't be anxious about anything, especially his future because that shows that he's not trusting in God to set his path. Shared about how he shouldn't work how to ensure his future but he should learn to work hard to the Lord."
12/2/2020,Jonas Cameron,12/02/2020,David,"Fellowshipped over Pergamos today, touched a lot of points. First talked about the word of God being a two-edged sword and how it functions to enlighten and judge us. When we are in a situation of mixture like the church in Pergamos we need judging and exposing. This is like John eating the scroll and it being sweet in his mouth but bitter in his stomach and also how the word is fire and a hammer. Led to us talking about how mixture perverts the truth and compromises the truth and how the church should be the pillar and base of the truth. We must pursue and know the truth but this can only be done by the exercise of our spirit, we must be careful not to merely study the letter of the Bible with our mind. Shared my personal enjoyment of 2 Tim 3:7 from my time in the training, how we can always be learning but never come to the full knowledge of the truth because the full knowledge of the truth comes from revelation and the experience and enjoyment of Christ, not mental exercise. Then fellowshipped about idolatry and fornication in bringing in the elements of the world into the church. The whole world lies in the evil one and Satan is the ruler of the world so when we love the world it becomes an idol corrupting our purity toward Christ and causing us to fall into spiritual fornication which leads to losing God's blessing as well as producing more mixture. We cannot bring our love for things of the world into church affairs. Briefly fellowshipped about the teaching of the Nicolaitans and whole the teaching of Balaam and the teaching of the Nicolaitans go hand in hand. He really appreciated Brother Nee's utterance of the difference in degree not in function and pointed out how the Lord said the same thing in his parables concerning service in the gospels. Finally ended with fellowship over the hidden manna and how our experiences of the Lord today become our reward and memorial in eternity. Today through good and bad as we feed upon the manna daily it becomes our reward in the future that we will always sweetly remember."
12/3/2020,Renbin Liu,12/03/2020,"David, Phil","Continued to pray for his job search then read and fellowshipped over 1 John 5. Talked about how the Lord's commandments are not burdensome because we have His life and because we love Him. Then fellowshipped how through faith we have an organic union with Christ which enables to overcome the world and used the story of Moses's staff turning into a serpent to illustrate the subtlety and deviousness of the world and how much we we need the Lord to help us to not rely on the world but to overcome. Then had some prayer over fellowship and how we should pray according to God's will. Ended with some fellowship on how we can know God's will, not just by our organic union but also through receiving revelation from the word. We need to ask for a spirit of wisdom and revelation so that the mystery of God's will could be made known to us."
12/3/2020,Travis Hank,12/03/2020,David,"Had some fellowship over ch4 of Mere Christianity which led into fellowship concerning living under God's direct rule instead just the rule of right and wrong in our conscience. Led to him asking what's an example of having a decision where this comes into play and I used the example of his job search. Could have 2 options and both are good and fine, but one you feel peace and one you don't and it could be the one you don't feel peace about is your preference. Led to a lot of fellowship about our personal experience of learning to trust the Lord and opening to the Lord about our future and major decisions. Very sweet and good time. Ended with more prayer for us to live to the Lord in all that we do."
12/4/2020,Sophia Fang,12/03/2020,Laura,Read the second half of LS Lev (continued from last week). Had a sweet time of prayer together and fellowship over the chapter. Spent time to fellowship what does it mean to have God's speaking in the meetings of the church. 
12/4/2020,Katia Pendowski,12/03/2020,"Lisa, Laura",Caught up and then read John 2 together. Spent some time to fellowship over water being changed to wine - that it means death and dissatisfaction changed to resurrection life. We then listened to the podcast together.
12/4/2020,Jessica Wang,12/03/2020,"Laura, Zoya","Talked about TG and family. Then, read John 2 together. Talked about ""the third day"" and the principle of changing death into life that impressed her from the podcast."
12/4/2020,Helen Yang,11/30/2020,Laura,"(with Debbie!) Talked about midterms and family and TG. Then, read Luke 23 together. Spent some time talking about v.40-42 - how the Lord died even though He was perfect and did not deserve any kind of judgement, yet He died for us."
12/7/2020,Daniel Kim,12/02/2020,David,Met briefly before Bible study to prepare for intro on the New Jerusalem
12/7/2020,Roger Jin,12/04/2020,David,"Met with Roger briefly just to catch up and see how he's doing. He's doing well and will be living with his girlfriend together in California until January, then they'll both move to New Jersey to be together during IAP and winter break in Roger's parents' house. They'll probably both be on campus next semester."
12/7/2020,Abraham Park,12/04/2020,David,"Got together and sang some songs, then read John 3 and had some fellowship over the major points and how we should live in the appreciation and enjoyment of our regeneration, touching the divine life in us all the time."
12/8/2020,Jonas Cameron,12/06/2020,David,"Fellowshipped over Thyatira in ""The Orthodoxy of the Church."" He agreed with all the interpretations regarding the Roman Catholic Church but we spent most of the time fellowshipping about how the mixture in Pergamos in its most developed state ends up in the terrible situation of Thyatira and how we must guard ourselves from mixture. Ultimately led to fellowship about the Bible being the unique authority and loving the Bible and seeking the Lord concerning who we should follow when seeking the proper interpretation of the word."
12/8/2020,Garrett Robinson,12/07/2020,David,"Reviewed the IPMM, he said he was a bit confused about how we can make God's job harder by not consecrating since nothing is hard for God but then said the picture of the Potter and the clay helped him to grasp the main point. Then read John 5 and had some fellowship. Emphasized vv39-40 about coming to the Lord in all that we do whether it's seemingly related to the Christian life or not. He appreciated the example of playing sports and how we can be far from the Lord when playing sports and may need to repent of our behavior, thoughts, and attitude when we are finished, this is a practical example coming to the Lord."
12/11/2020,Renbin Liu,12/10/2020,"David, Phil","Read Rev 3:7-22 about Philadelphia and Laodicea, Renbin shared with us that as he read the 7 epistles to the churches he thought they were just historical and meant for the people of that time but said that the Lord spoke to him and said no these letters are all for you. That opened our fellowship concerning not being lukewarm and being poor in spirit and how we today need to overcome these conditions. Then we spent some time talking about Rev 3:12 and trying to expose the leaven of heaven. Showed that the NJ descends out of heaven and that the promise to those who overcome is to be a pillar in the temple, the NJ. So the NJ isn't a physical city nor is it in heaven, it's we with God for eternity. Spoke about how that doesn't sound so attractive because we still love material things and want material blessings when really the ultimate blessing is God Himself and that is the great reward we need to see given to the overcomers."
12/11/2020,Travis Hank,12/10/2020,David,"Talked and caught up, he updated me on his job search and how school and research has been going which has been a lot, he's been really slammed, averaged like less than 4 hours of sleep for the past three days. Near the end he asked me if I had any burdens and I shared some things about family and the work at MIT and then he said the reason he asked was because the verse of the day was Gal 6:2, Bear one another’s burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ completely. Then we ended praying for each others' burdens, it was very sweet."
12/11/2020,Victor Damptey,12/11/2020,David,"with James. So good to see them again after a month or so without an appointment. We talked about finals coming up and how they were feeling about coming back to campus next semester. Then read the chapter of the day, John 9 and some good fellowship. Victor appreciated how the blind man who was healed testified of his experience without any shame to those who asked and also how our sufferings today are opportunities of God to manifest His works in us. Expounded on these by talking about our need to not be ashamed of the gospel and just to speak our personal experience of Christ and then also connecting what he said to 2 Cor 4:16-18. Ended with prayer."
12/11/2020,James Nguyen,12/11/2020,David,"with Victor. Was touched by the verses at the end of John 9 saying that the Lord comes for judgement so those who do not see may see and those that see may become blind. He said that this applies to our confessing our hidden sins when we may not be willing to repent and then begin to pity ourselves, then we are far from the Lord."
12/21/2020,Jonas Cameron,12/12/2020,David,"Read about Sardis in ""The Orthodoxy of the Church"" and had some very good fellowship about needed to allow the Lord to complete His work in us and no being stuck. Jonas himself pointed out that many denominations do this, they recover a certain aspect of the truth and then remain there not allowing the Lord to complete what He wants. He also mentioned how division among the denominations has contributed to the lack of completion. As wonderful as the Reformation was we need to go on!"
12/21/2020,Daniel Lee,12/16/2020,David,"Caught up and chatted, he shared how recently he was convicted by another brother who used to care from him when he was an undergrad at Columbia about slacking on his Bible reading so he wants to pick that up again. Then we read John 13 about foot washing  and enjoyed fellowshipping over restricting ourselves to serve others just as the Lord did. We love others by restricting ourselves and laying ourselves aside to give them the living water to wash them."
12/21/2020,Travis Hank,12/17/2020,David,"Chatted for a while about his job search and such and then transitioned to fellowshipping over the verse of the day from Matt 5. Ended up reading Matt 5:13-20 and had some good fellowship about the Lord fulfilling the higher requirements of the NT by living again in us. Travis then brought up the thought of what makes human beings special compared to other animals. Led to fellowship over Zech 12:1 concerning man's spirit and how man is meant for eternity not for the temporary things of earth. He said, it's easy to live in the moment because you can see it, living for eternity takes faith. Ended with some good prayer."
12/21/2020,Steven Liu,12/18/2020,"David, Victor","Last time with Victor ;( told him about Winter Reading and he signed up for a book then read the introduction of Sit, Walk, Stand together as well as Eph 1. He was impressed in Eph 1 that we were predestinated for God's purpose so we should live for that but the question is what is God's purpose. We shared about needed a spirit of wisdom and revelation to see what God has prepared for us and how we need to open our heart and have a proper heart in order for the eyes of our heart to be enlightened to see God's purpose."
12/21/2020,Jonas Cameron,12/21/2020,David,"Read about Philadelphia in ""The Orthodoxy of the Church"" and has some very good fellowship. He was very touched by the fact that we should not have a pastoral system in the church and that the church should not be denominated and bear other names. He even brought this up for fellowship with his parents and read the passage about how the pastoral system is wrong from the book to his parents. He said that his parents received thoughtfully and that they will probably pray and fellowship more in the coming days and weeks, even months over this. He mentioned his mother said that teaching is a gift not something you are qualified to do by a degree but that their SDA church practices the standard pastoral system. He said his father was more receptive but mother got a bit defensive about some of the other things they fellowshipped about. He then mentioned that over the past year and a half he has been realizing that many of the things his church practices are unscriptural and that he didn't want to be tied to denomination, he just wanted to follow God's will. He said he has read Brother Nee's writings but now he wants the Lord to speak to him clearly from the word concerning His will and the church. We then had some fellowship about how all the things in the Bible are not just promised but they are bequeathed to us like in a will and how they are all ours as long as you claim them. Then had some fellowship about little power and how a daily revival and affording the spontaneous power of the law of the Spirit of life the right conditions and environments to operate in us results in true revival. Told the testimony of Brother Lee and the revival in Cheefoo without explicitly mentioning his name. He shared how everything the apostles experienced in Acts 1-4 should be experienced by the believers today as well because God has not changed. Then ended by saying how Daniel saw God's will in the speaking Jeremiah and prayed and that led to the return of the children of Israel back to the good land for the rebuilding of the temple (in a way that was seemingly not as glorious and smaller than the initial building) that ushered in the first coming of Christ. Today as we read the word we must pray over the revelation we receive in order for the prophetic word concerning the building of the temple physically but more importantly spiritually as the church on the proper ground would be accomplished to usher in Christ's second coming."

1/8/2021,Jonas Cameron,01/04/2021,David,"Had fellowship over Laodicea in ""The Orthodoxy of the Church"" and talked about not being lukewarm as well as opinions coming in when we are hotly pursuing the Lord leading to division."
1/8/2021,Garrett Robinson,01/04/2021,David,Read Acts 8 and had some good fellowship over not loving money and world as well as needing help to understand what the word really means.
1/8/2021,Daniel Lee,01/06/2021,David,Read Matt 2 and fellowshipped over how Herod tried to kill the baby Jesus. Related it to his struggling with remaining in his PhD program where he feels the Lord has placed him sovereignly but also where he doesn't feel like he has much direction with his research. We can be like Herod when we try to do something outwardly to change our situation like perhaps considering finding work instead of continuing research when that is how the Lord is seeking to bring forth Christ in our lives. Also shared about how the living leading of the Spirit paired with the word to find Christ and needing a heart to pursue Christ.
1/8/2021,Victor Damptey,01/08/2021,David,Caught up and then read Acts 12 and fellowshipped over how God needs our prayer in order to move on the earth also tying it to our reading Acts 10 on Wednesday night. Also related it to the current political atmosphere in the US right now and how the world situation is an indicator of the Lord's move but needs our cooperation in prayer to carry out what He wants to do in the midst of the world situation.
1/8/2021,James Nguyen,01/08/2021,David,"With Victor, see above"

1/19/2021,Victor Damptey,01/15/2021,David,"Read Acts 18 and had some good fellowship over not being afraid because the Lord is with us. Shared with him about God being provision, pleasure, and protection to man in the garden of Eden but man losing all three in the fall. Today God wants to recover us back to experiencing Christ as our provision, pleasure, and protection and not the replacements that Satan has made in the world."
1/19/2021,Jonas Cameron,01/14/2021,David,"Finished ""The Orthodoxy of the Church"" and had some fellowship over the ground of the church. Also talked briefly about the rapture."

1/22/2021,Ben Gao,1/22/21 Th,Marc,"Called Ben Gao for 5 min on Thursday morning right before his UROP (~8:50-8:55). We read a paragraph about being in the right position of confessing to the Lord before we read the Bible, and muted ourselves for 1 minute and practiced/applied confessing to the Lord to touch Him. Ben was open to calling again in the morning and suggested calling next week MWF for 5 minutes in the morning."
1/22/2021,Ben Gao,1/21/21 Th,Marc,"Had lunch with Ben Gao over zoom. In coordination with Randy Juste (serving in Gainesville, FL), he delivered Popeyes to Ben. Ben was really happy and told me that he (Ben) and Randy live 5 minutes apart. I encouraged Ben to get together with Randy if he can.

I also invited Ben to the Kickoff on LD, and Ben said he could make it! And then I also ask about attending the LD table meeting, to be able to meet the other saints and to also enjoy our right to speak our enjoyment of Christ to one another (especially for this new year to have a new start), and he said if I emailed him the link, he would be willing to join. Thank you, Lord!"

1/26/2021,Doris Fu,01/26/2020,Cassia (FTTA),"Have been having times to read S, W, S with Doris over interim. Some encouraging highlights - I asked her what she thought it means to be a Christian after we read a portion from the book, and she said that her concept has been changing, from someone just being good and doing good to having our source in God. She asks questions about the political views and why Christians are divided about certain matters, why the Lord has an ""expectation"" for us to worship Him. Have brought out the importance of the pure Word being the truth and God being our Creator and in a sense having the absolute right over us, but how His heart is always good towards us though the outward environment may be hard. It is encouraging to see her openness week by week, even if we are just reading together. Pray that the Lord would continue to reveal His purpose to her, be brought to the saints and to the students (have tried to invite her to the Wednesday times but she ends up being busy). She has a younger brother, Stephen, who is 12, who is quite closed to her family. Pray for Stephen that he would be open and eventually even get saved! Doris is coming back to Cambridge Feb. 1, told her if she needs any help with moving in to let me know.. sorry should have broken this up into multiple updates."
1/26/2021,Adun Obisesan,01/26/2019,Cassia (FTTA),"Have been calling Adun Obisesan around once a week to catch up and read something together.

He's not available for the first Bible study tonight, but he said that he would front-load schedule and studying so that he can make Bible studies in the future. I told him about the retreat and he said that he could probably make the third session and I encouraged him to also make the first session. He's also interested in meeting up on Lord's day. I also told him to invite his roommate Ty to see if he would like to meet us for a picnic with the guys."

3/3/2021,Eugenia Feng,03/03/2021,Zoya FTTA ,"just got to know each other a bit. We talked about food a lot so I mentioned how I literally need to eat every 2 hours. And how it's the same with spiritual food. 
I asked her if she'd want to read sometime and she answered really vaguely. so I just asked if she could do 15 min every Wednesday and she seemed okay with it.
hopefully see her at home meeting with Aiden and Elisa."

3/4/2021,Sophia Fang,03/04/2021,Laura,"We went for a walk around Central/MIT. She had a question regarding what we read in 1Cor14 last night about women not speaking in the church as it pertains to defining doctrine. Her question: What about sisters in church history - Mrs. Penn-Lewis, Madam Guyon, M.E. Barber - who recovered the truth. 
Then, we had some fellowship in general about what can we do/our attitude when we don't understand something that we read in the Bible."
3/4/2021,Jessica Wang,03/04/2021,"Laura, Zoya","Read ""The Normal Christian Life"" - the first part of chapter 1. Had some good fellowship. Jessica was impressed that the solution to both our sins (actions) and sin (who we are) is just the work and Person of Jesus - His Blood and His Cross."
3/5/2021,Travis Hank,03/05/2021,David,"Continued our fellowship over ""Mere Christianity"" and talked about what it means to love people and how we can be saved from the greatest sin of pride. To truly love people we must understand how God loves us, He loves us by doing everything with the intent of giving us more Christ. We must do the same to others. We can be saved from pride by meeting God face to face just like Isaiah, Job, and Peter did."
3/5/2021,Garrett Robinson,03/05/2021,"David, Hanley","Spent a lot of time bonded over our love for video games and manga/anime, I felt the time was very profitable, I have never seen Garrett smile so much during an appointment, I think he was very cherished. It was also encouraging that eventually he was the one who brought up that we should get into the word. Read 1 Cor 16 and had some brief fellowship over it and then I spoke to Garrett about what the prophesying meeting would be like on Lord's Day. Let's keep praying for Garrett, Spencer, and Travis to really enjoy the time on Lord's Day!"
3/5/2021,Adun Obisesan,03/05/2021,"Laura, Cassia","We just met up and caught up about classes, grad applications/decisions. We only had 30min, and ran out of time to fellowship or get into anything together."

Read 2 Cor 2 and had some fellowship over not being ignorant of Satan's schemes and I shared with from the booklet ""Satan's Strategy Against the Church."" Three main things: replacing Christ, clergy-laity, and division. Especially focused on replacing Christ and shared with him from the Morning Revival and he really picked up on good things in culture replacing Christ. Then had some more fellowship on Rom 8 and Heb 2 which he has been in recently, mainly fellowshipping over what glorification is."
3/8/2021,Helen Yang,03/08/2021,Laura,"with Debbie!! We spent some time catching up and talking about favorite food, but then Debbie needed to leave early and that ended our time. But, Helen and I texted a little after our time and are we are now working out a time to get Ramen together. "

3/10/2021,Dominic Maggio,03/09/2021,"David, Marc","Prayed for his grad school applications and shared about Abraham following the Lord even though he knew not where he was going. Then he asked us a question about evolution and we shared with him about the human spirit. Ended that discussion by saying that the question of why humans and the universe exists is actually much more important than how and is the focus of the Bible. He was very impressed by that and that may be the focus of our next appointment. At the end he also shared how the Lord touched him recently about his lack of speaking about Christ to his dorm mates. Encouraged him using the experience of Peter, the Lord comes to us after our failures and only asks one question, ""Do you love Me?"""
3/10/2021,Eugenia Feng,03/10/2021,Zoya ,short and sweet. read 2 Cor. 4 since she wanted to go along with the daily manna schedule. we both shared a little. I encouraged her to feel free to ask any questions she has going forward.
3/11/2021,Ashley Ke,03/10/2022,Laura,"First appt!! 🙌 We met up at Next House and went for a walk along the river.

3/11/2021,Ben Gao,03/10/2021,"Marc, David","Continued reading ""The Experience of Life"" and how our heart is incurable which should cause us to very much appreciate our regeneration which gave us a new heart and a new life."
3/12/2021,Diana Renteria,03/12/2021,Lisa,"Read from chapter 9 of The Normal
Christian Faith where there was a section explaining why God has to save us because of His righteousness. Diana opened up and mentioned again how she struggled in high school with feeling whether or not she was good enough to be saved. She had broken through to a degree but turns out she still struggles with this a lot, even in the past year.
I was able to fellowship with her that perhaps the reason she still struggles back and forth is because she hasn’t been baptized yet! Turns out her parents have been telling her she should get baptized and she’s been considering it a lot! She was so thankful that I brought this matter up to her as well and will start looking into whether she can get baptized at the church she is currently meeting with."
3/12/2021,Daniel Lee,03/11/2021,David,Read the first half of Luke 20 and had some fellowship over religious jealousy and not being political in our care for people. Then shared with him the contrast between the young rich ruler in Luke 18 and Zaccheus in Luke 19 and we had some very rich fellowship over that.
3/12/2021,Travis Hank,03/11/2021,David,"Continued our fellowship over ""Mere Christianity."" Eventually the conversation led to how Travis doesn't agree with how much the ministry tries to interpret the Old Testament. We had a lot of fellowship over this concluding in our need to know God's purpose in a personal way and the way to know God's purpose is to love Him."

Led to Heb 11:6, believing that God is and that we are not, so living a life of faith is realizing that we should not be the source of anything we do but instead it should be Christ living in us. Also mentioned Abraham producing Isaac at the age of 100 being a picture of a life of faith and grace and how often we produce Ishmael instead of Isaac because we are and God is not in our lives."

He mentioned how he wished church leadership in general was more diverse (race, profession, background etc) and that more CEOs and world leaders were strong Christians. He mentioned how more universities should offer double majors with their seminary/divinity school and the secular majors (e.g. Princeton). Spent some time talking about how all Christians should be Christians first and then their profession second. Then also talked about to be a strong Christian doesn't firstly mean studying theology or getting a degree from a divinity school but loving the Lord with our first love, only then can we truly know God. Concluded with praying over 1 Cor 2:9-10."
3/26/2021,Garrett Robinson,03/26/2021,"David, Hanley",Read and fellowshipped over Gal 5 and the difference between trying to keep the law (do's and don't's) vs walking by the Spirit and the effect and result of the two ways of living.

It was a lot of information so we walked through each verse, read some of the footnotes, and asked her what the ladder was after reading John 1:51 and Genesis 28:12 (ladder = Son of Man). Talked a little bit of experience of how He can relate to us because as a man, but He is also unlimited as God. She smiled and said ""that's nice"". She told me that she randomly samples portions in the New Testament, but she has a hard time understanding the verses. Pointed her to Philippians 4:6-7 (something that I enjoyed and may be easier to understand). She said amen!"

3/31/2021,Ben Gao,03/31/2021,"Marc, David","Continued our reading of ""The Experience of Life"" started ch2 on clearance of the past. Shared about how Zaccheus is really our pattern in clearing things that come between us and the Lord. It should be a spontaneous result of our spending time with Him and it should be done out of joy not out of duty! The contrast is the young rich ruler in Luke 18."
3/31/2021,Ashley Ke,03/31/2021,Laura,we just went for a walk. talked about classes and internships. She had been enjoying Bible Studies this semester - and asked what they were like in person.

He was quite amazed that there is a difference and that we have direct connection and touch with the Lord in our spirit. He pointed out the difference between knowing about God and knowing God and we talked about how they correspond to the soul and the spirit using the analogy of electricity. Then we also fellowshipped about having roots by having private personal experiences of the Lord and I inoculated him a little bit because he had some questions about v18, being defrauded of our prize."
4/11/2021,Doris Fu,04/11/2021,Cassia (FTTA),"had a conversation with Doris for about half an hour, and then we read John 2. Some really encouraging highlights: 1) in her prayer before reading, she asked the Lord to come into our mornings, afternoon, evening, and while we are studying! 2) she told me after reading that she thinks that John 2 was the first chapter she read after she received the Lord and got sent home last year (I didn't even know that she started reading the Bible on her own that early!!) 3) she wasn't very impressed at first about the miracle of the Lord Jesus turning water into wine because it wasn't like walking on water or healing someone, but we talked some about the significance of the story and pointed her to the outline points embedded in the chapter, and then she was really impressed. Then she asked if the outline points were in the original version of the Bible or if people who studied the Word added them. If I said correctly, I told her that these things have been revealed over time to many who loved the Lord and His Word and took the time to study it. 4) she told me about 
 a portion she read this week of the Father taking care of the birds and not having anxiety, 5) after we finished, she said ""I really enjoyed this reading!"" Lord, keep Doris consistently in Your Word, and keep drawing her to fellowship more!"

4/13/2021,Dominic Maggio,04/13/2021,"David, Marc","Dom had two questions this week. The first was what it meant for Jesus to tell the scribe in Matt 8:20 that the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head. Led to fellowship over the cost of following the Lord and loving the Lord more than all else. Then he asked about why Jesus doesn't just take care of all the demons and negative things on the earth right now since he did that throughout His earthly ministry. We shared about how miracles don't help God achieve what He desires. After the Lord performed so many miracles and helped so many people only 120 were in the upper room. Left him some ""homework"" to have normal conversations with the Lord throughout his days this week and to have a personal experience with the Lord and hear His voice."
4/15/2021,Sophia Fang,04/15/2021,Laura,"Continued reading ""The Glorious Church"", chapter 1.

""Our mouth shut up defeats us / And wins the devil's smile..."""
4/15/2021,Jessica Wang,04/15/2021,"Laura, Zoya","Finished chapter 3 of ""The Normal Christian Life"". We talked about how the path of our progress begins with our knowing - how precious it is that we know these divine facts: the blood cleanses our every sin and the cross deals with even who we are. We had some fellowship about enjoying and speaking the divine facts and not standing with our feelings."
4/17/2021,Jonas Cameron,04/17/2021,David,"Read and fellowshipped over 1 Thes 4 mainly on sanctification and how God's will is to fill! Very rich fellowship, Jonas shared on how God wants to justify but then He wants to sanctify. We ended with some very dear prayer for his family, they've been very busy and stressed with getting ready to move to Tennessee and Jonas also opened up about some members in family who are currently struggling in their relationship with the Lord and in aspects of human life. May the abundance of grace reach and supply this dear family."
4/19/2021,Helen Yang,04/19/2021,Laura,"Read 1 Thes 5 - talked about v.24 - our God is wholly (completely) sanctifying our entire being, and He is the Faithful One who will fully do it!"

Also shared about gospel preaching and v11 stood out to him so we had good fellowship on that and I shared Neh 8:10 with him about the joy of the Lord being our strength. I asked him how he experiences the Lord as his strength and he said the big three haha, singing, praying, and reading the word and shared song he had been enjoying recently. Ended with some really rich prayer over the content of the song about keeping our mind ""stayed"" on Christ and awaiting the Lord's coming."
4/20/2021,Dominic Maggio,04/20/2021,"David, Marc","Prepped for Bible study intro tomorrow about God as our Shepherd, we learned that Dom doesn't enjoy sharing about his personal experiences of Christ which came out near the end of our times together.

4/22/2021,Jessica Wang,04/22/2021,"Laura, Zoya","After some sweet time talking and catching up, we started reading chapter 4 of ""The Normal Christian Life"". We talked about the definition and meaning of reckoning, which follows our knowing. This accounting of facts that never changes."

Garrett contributed to the discussion the parable in Matt. 25; we shouldn't bury the talent we received, but we should invest it! We ended the time with David sharing about fanning the Spirit into flame being done in an atmosphere of love and how one practical way to fan the Spirit into flame is by saying ""Lord Jesus, I love You"" the first thing in the morning"

At the end he said he noticed how I reference footnotes in my Bible and asked where he could get one! Pointed him to BfA and he ordered a NT! Let's pray that Jabes will read it and enjoy the footnotes and also let's pray that the Lord would guard him from the evil one and that I could have another time with him to properly inoculate him."

5/7/2021,Garrett Robinson,05/07/2021,"David, Hanley","Read and fellowshipped over Titus 3, he was wondering what it means to be divisive so we took some time to talk about God desiring His children to be one and how important it is to God that all the believers would be one. Then we spent time fellowshipping over the renewing of the Holy Spirit and remaining fresh in our relationship with the Lord. Garrett said that the best way for us to remain fresh is to be in fellowship with other believers consistently and one thing to avoid is not reading the word or a routine reading of the word without any prayer or deeper consideration."
5/7/2021,Travis Hank,05/07/2021,David,"Short call of just catching up and having some further fellowship on this week's Bible study material.

He also mentioned that he felt condemned recently because he wasn't able to spend as much time with the Lord and on spiritual things recently due to school being really busy so we talked about coming forward to the throne of grace just as we are, faith being believing that God is and we are not, and also faith allowing us to substantiate the promises of God."
5/13/2021,Spencer Yoder,05/11/2021,"David, Marc","Caught up initially with Spencer about his Rook one trip this past weekend with his fraternity (he stayed up until 8 a.m. on Sunday calling the past alumni of his fraternity).
We read Hebrews 2 and fellowshipped about the matter of what propitiation meant, how Christ is the one propitiating for us, he's the propitiation sacrifice on our behalf, and he is also the propitiation place that we can meet on, like in the Old Testament in the holy of holies. We also talked about the matter of making Christ's experiential to us and Spencer said that verse 13 stood out to him on the matter of trusting in the Lord, and he realized that it's a matter of having a more informal and intimate relationship with the Lord so that we can experience Him more. We prayed at the end for this."
5/13/2021,Ben Gao,05/12/2021,"Marc, David","Continued reading about consecration in ""The Experience of Life"" and had some fellowship about our personal experiences of consecration.

Ended with some prayer."
5/13/2021,Dominic Maggio,05/13/2021,"David, Marc","He's currently trying to decide between on campus and off campus housing in the fall and needs to make a decision by tomorrow. He said he had prayed about it but feels that either way it's about the same. Shared some things about not just ending up with the ""best"" choice but transacting with the Lord and getting to know the Lord in a personal way. It didn't seem to penetrate very much so we can continue to pray for Dom's relationship with the Lord to become more intimate."
5/13/2021,Daniel Lee,05/13/2021,David,"Continued our fellowship over Acts, Daniel was very impressed Paul, who originally killed Christians was now one who was willing to die for the Lord so we had some good fellowship over that and also answered some of his questions concerning details in this section of Acts."
5/13/2021,Travis Hank,05/13/2021,David,Missed Bible study because he lost track of time while writing his thesis and said he was really bummed so we reviewed the Bible study together. Concerning John 12 Travis referenced the account in Luke 10 and said how the story of contrasting Martha and Mary always impressed him that we need to focus not on doing but enjoying the Lord. Then regarding Ephesus he shared about how any church's focus should always be uniquely on Christ and loving Christ not good works or public service. Overall very awesome fellowship.

We fellowshipped about the “main point” of Heb. 8 being the new covenant is superior to the old covenant, and, in the new covenant, which is in vv. 10-12, we can enjoy a direct, personal relationship with God according to the law of the Spirit of life inscribed upon our hearts (My laws…on their hearts I will inscribe them)!"

She told me that was struggling a little bit because she felt like she hadn't changed over the semester (in her spiritual life), and even felt like she maybe was going backwards. We also talked about her hoping to maybe live with a family in Berkeley and get connected with them - something she has been missing so far in her time at MIT. 
We had a really sweet time together. "

Mainly just chatted and caught up, he told me that unfortunately his grandmother passed away quite suddenly earlier this year and it was really hard on his family so that's why he didn't want to call for most of the semester, but it seems like things are better now. He seems quite happy now and when I suggested that he should get connected to the saints in NYC he seemed quite receptive, let's pray he gets plugged into the church life in NYC."

By eating and drinking Christ we become His match that He can marry. The encouraging thing was that at the end of our time he said that he finally understood what eating and drinking the Lord meant after hearing it many times in group meeting. May Dominic be the best eater and drinker of Christ!

9/23/2021,Wilhem Hector,09/23/2021,"Marc, Sam Lin","Had our first appointment with Wilhem at the Stud. 

He was coming from class and hadn't eaten yet. We got to know him more, and we told him about our Bible studies, small groups, and IPMM (and showed him the highlight video). He goes by his last name (Hector), enjoys playing basketball (but hasn't exercised in a while because of his psets), grew up from Haiti (though he finished his last two years of HS in Norway), is interested in course 2A or 16, went to the FPOP on Discovering Energy, would like to buy a heavy coat for winter, and he's not planning to be in any club this semester except for one that he applied for that does planning for events.

9/23/2021,Shulammite Lim,09/23/2021,Laura,"Shulammite opened up regarding the training and wanted to have some fellowship. ""It's not really a matter of IF, but a matter of WHEN I'll go to the training"". She's considering doing an MEng and medical school. I was able to share some of my testimony of how the Lord led me to the training. Ended with some really sweet prayer together. "
9/23/2021,Jonas Cameron,09/23/2021,"David, Tim","Long appointment today mainly asking Jonas to explain his understanding of the importance of keeping the Sabbath as a NT believer. He had a lot to say and it's quite clear he feels this is a major point in the divine revelation that cannot be compromised (without major loss/consequence). We fellowshipped with him concerning not allowing teachings to divide the Body of Christ. It was pretty clear at the end of the time that we have very different priorities with regards to our practice of the church but I don't think there were any feelings of animosity or criticism, it was a genuine and open talk. We ended with some really sweet fellowship and prayer about how our focus is to be faithful to what we feel the Lord has shown us and not to tradition or any conformity to a set of teaching but to seek to love the Lord more and be open to His speaking and shining."
9/23/2021,Delight Nweneka,09/23/2021,"Katy, Rachel, Laura","First appointment over lunch to read Romans.  She invited her friend, Grace (Wellesley student cross-registered at MIT) to join us too.  They spent a lot of time trying to find each other in Stata, and there were introductions, but we finally got into Romans 1:1-17 in the last 7 minutes or so and all of us quickly shared a verse we enjoyed.  They were really open and eager to share!  Delight asked if we could do it again, and we were able to establish a weekly appointment with them!  We stayed and talked with Grace after Delight went to class.  She's already connected to a Christian club at Wellesley and goes to the Symphony church, but wants to be connected at MIT too (she's CS, taking 2 classes at MIT, and 2 classes at Wellesley)."
9/29/2021,Debbie Zhuang,09/28/2021,"Laura, Katy, Rachel","finished chapter 30 of the Life-Study of Genesis and had some sweet prayer together.

9/30/2021,Jean Billa,09/29/2021,David,Started just by chatting a bit and then he mentioned that he had gone to the Catholic Bible study which had covered Genesis 3 about the fall of man. He said that he was interested in learning more about creation so we took the opportunity to read Genesis 1 together. Stressed that the focus of creation is not a description of the process of creation but of God's purpose centering around man. Eventually shared how we  are vessels meant to contain God's life and we need to take in God's life more each day by our contact with the Bible.
9/30/2021,Jacob Rodriguez,09/30/2021,"David, Sam","Chatted and then asked him if there's anything he's been interested in recently regarding the Bible. He said he wanted to read a book about common heresies and so we spent some time talking about what is truth and how to know the truth. Eventually led to fellowshipping about not just acquiring information from the Bible but having a personal touch with the Lord. He says he has a hard time ""snacking"" on the word so we encouraged him that we don't always have to dive into the depths of the verses we read, we can simply enjoy the milk found in the word."
9/30/2021,Ethan Harbaugh,09/30/2021,David,Read Matt 28 and then read some of John 20 about Mary at the tomb. Shared about how we shouldn't just satisfied with the facts but desire a personal experience of the Lord.

9/30/2021,Delight Nweneka,09/30/2021,"Laura, Katy, Rachel","with GRACE CHANG (Wellesley friend). Read Romans 1:18-32. Grace asked a question about homosexuality and having friends who identify as queer and Christian. We had some really sweet fellowship together (the time was very mutual) and ended with 1John5:16 - when we see these friends, we first ASK, but our goal is to give God Himself as life to them. 
We spent some time to pray together, and everyone prayed  for each other. It was very sweet."
10/4/2021,Ashley Ke,10/04/2021,Laura,"Ashley said she is struggling being a ""good Christian"" - she just received the Lord toward the end of HS, and she said she believes, but doesn't always pray or read the Bible. (she ordered a RcV). She wants to have a regular time to read the Bible together. 
We read Mark 2 today and had some fellowship about the last few verses - not just caring about what is right or wrong, but caring about the Lord. 
Very sweet time! Let's pray that she signs up and commits to come to the retreat!"
10/5/2021,Debbie Zhuang,10/05/2021,"Laura, Katy, Rachel","Finished the first two sections of LS of Genesis, msg. 31.  Fellowshipped briefly on how the Lord's way to save us is not to get rid of the difficult situation, but to open a way through His cross into Him."
10/5/2021,Dominic Maggio,09/30/2021,David,"Mainly just talked and chatted for the whole hour, he just talked about various things and I listened or asked questions. At the very end shared a verse I enjoyed from that day's Bible reading (Matt 28:20) about the Lord being with us all the days."
10/5/2021,Luc Picard,10/04/2021,"David, Marc, Tim, Sam","All of us brothers were just sitting in Stud when we saw Luc walk by with his lunch and we invited him to sit with us. We ended up spending two hours together chatting, then reading the chapter of the day and having some fellowship, and then chatting some more before he had to go to his next class. Overall it was an awesome time!"
10/5/2021,Ethan Harbaugh,10/05/2021,David,Went running with Ethan today at the MIT track! We spent about an hour total together and chatted while we ran about various things. It was good just to spend some casual time together. We also chatted with Garrett a bit who was at soccer practice.
10/6/2021,Diana Renteria,10/06/2021,Lisa,"Continued reading through The Normal Christian Faith. Had some really sweet fellowship over the reading: when we realize our inability, then we can experience God making us able! Also, Diana is attending a retreat with her church this weekend, but felt like with her lesser workload this semester, she should still be able to go to our retreat as well!"
10/7/2021,Delight Nweneka,10/07/2021,"Rachel, Katy, Laura","Read through Romans 2 and talked about having a personal relationship with the Lord for what the law does not cover in this age. She’s stressed about psets and an upcoming interview, but she signed up for the fall retreat!!"
10/7/2021,Shulammite Lim,10/07/2021,"Laura, Katy","Overall very sweet time. We prayed that we would each have one lower classman student written in our hearts to be under our care. As well, for the overall release of the MIT students to attend the college fall retreat. "
10/12/2021,Sophia Fang,10/12/2021,Laura,"So sweet!! Sophia just started talking (she talked the whole time hehe) and told me all about what's going on with her - she's super swamped by classes and TAing and a bit stressed out about grad school applications and a big application for a fellowship for next year. She also told me she's been struggling to have a consistent time with the Lord in the morning and has not been getting into the HWMR as much as she wants to. She said her time in Berkeley this summer was so awesome because she had so much free time she could spend with the Lord, and was hoping to ride that through this semester, but hasn't and seemed a bit discouraged. (She said one of the only times she has to talk to the Lord is when she runs everyday.)
We did set up a weekly time for the semester! We'll be getting into the HWMR together on Tuesday afternoons. "
10/12/2021,Luc Picard,10/12/2021,David,Sat with him as he ate an extremely late lunch (at 4:30 😮) we chatted for a bit and eventually came around to talking about how his Bible reading was going. He mentioned he was reading the Apocrypha because he’s curious concerning Catholic practices and teachings and he’s been going to TCC Bible studies (where he sees Jean). He quoted one of his high school teachers who told him the Bible is not a book of information but of transformation. This led to a lot of sweet fellowship about the fruit of the Spirit and abiding in the Lord as the vine. Also set up a regular time week to week on Wednesdays at 1pm starting tomorrow!
10/13/2021,Garrett Robinson,10/06/2021,"David, Sam","Sat and chatted for a long time (1hr 45min!), the main spiritual content was concerning a Bible study Garrett had with some of his friends who believe in baptismal salvation. Led to a lot of good fellowship about being about to speak the truth and practicing to speak the truth. Told him we'll put him on Bible study intro one of the upcoming weeks."
10/13/2021,Jean Billa,10/06/2021,David,Can't remember what we talked about :/

10/13/2021,Jonas Cameron,10/07/2021,"David, Tim","Started reading ""The Divine Economy"" together! Had some wonderful fellowship over God's dispensing and being filled with the life of God and how this is what God loves. Brought in the matter of Gen 1:26, how man is an empty vessel that needs to be filled with the life of God."
10/13/2021,Ethan Harbaugh,10/07/2021,David,Read and fellowshipped over Mark 6 eventually settling on where faith comes from and what it is. Shared about faith coming from the word and from looking away unto Jesus. Then shared about faith being our sixth sense to substantiate spiritual things.
10/13/2021,Dominic Maggio,10/07/2021,David,"Chatted for a while and then asked him how his personal prayer had been going. He said it was going fine so I asked if we could say some prayers for me. Very sweet, really appreciated his heart and prayer."
10/13/2021,Daniel Lee,10/09/2021,David,"Grabbed dinner together in Allston, it was a good time just hanging out and catching up, will continue our reading of ""The Economy of God"" together next week."
10/13/2021,Garrett Robinson,10/13/2021,David,"Chatted a bit about soccer, he's still waiting to hear back for his x-ray results since getting injured. last home game on 10/30. he's been meeting with some friends on Fridays and having discussions (in conjunction with talking to his pastor) concerning whether baptism is necessary for someone to be saved and why it's so urgent to be baptized. we drew/presented the three parts of man to him and explained how Christ wants to make home in our heart throughout our life, wants His personality/kindness/confidence to be expressed through us. Also, in the type of the Red Sea, the children of Israel had to cross the Red Sea before they could continue in their experience in the wilderness and the good land, so in our experience baptism is crucial for us to go on in the Christian life. Not much response, but he prayed a bit along those lines. Pray for him to be able to join this Friday as the message will be very much in the same vein (he has practice til 7pm but likely not playing due to injury so would be able to leave early)."
10/14/2021,Delight Nweneka,10/14/2021,"Laura, Katy, Rachel","Small group Bible study with Delight, Grace, and Shulammite to read Romans 3. Talked about the law versus faith and having a personal relationship with the Lord. Delight and Grace are pretty overwhelmed with midterms and psets, but are still very happy to meet. We prayed for their joy in school, and for aligning our hearts with the Lord. This was Shulammite’s first time to join the appointment with Delight and Grace. She was quiet in the discussion, but we’re praying that she would start to pick up a burden for new ones."
10/14/2021,Sam Cruz,10/14/2021,Marc,"Got to spend a good amount of time (1 hr 45) with Sam, he talked about his view/study on evangelism and how some are called to be more offensive vs defensive in gospel preaching, we presented the matter of the common faith and receiving believers just based on that, and not any other practices, like prophesying. he was interested because he is speaking this LD on 1 Cor 14:31 and Acts 2:42 and was wondering how it can be lived out/practiced. We also talked about what grace is and how it is the person of Christ. hoping to get more weekly times with him."
10/14/2021,Luc Picard,10/13/2021,"David, Tim",Read Mark 11 together and fellowshipped about some matters concerning the Lord being a person and also not being showy. Eventually honed in on praying with faith and what it means to exercise faith in our prayers. Brought him Heb 12:2 and Rom 10:14 showing that when our prayers come out of our fixing our eyes on Jesus and out of our contact with Him in the word then we can be assured that our prayers will be answered. Gave him an example of pray-reading and then we all prayed over Mark 11:22 together.
10/14/2021,Ethan Harbaugh,10/14/2021,David,"Read and fellowshipped over Mark 12 concerning loving the Lord with our whole being. Also read Eph 2:1-7 concerning Ephesus leaving their first love but their reward for overcoming being to eat the tree of life. Shared on how when we love the Lord He rewards us by being our enjoyment. The way to the tree of life was closed off when we fell but reopened through the Lord's redemption, now all He desires for us is to enjoy Him."
10/14/2021,Dominic Maggio,10/14/2021,David,"Met up and chatted, when I asked him if he wanted to read something he said maybe not today and just wanted to chat. We kept talking and at the end of our time I asked if maybe we could pray for Rue's salvation together but he didn't feel comfortable about that so I asked if maybe we could just say some short prayers for me which he was happy to do. Let's pray that Dom's appetite for the word and for spiritual things in general would increase."
10/15/2021,Ashley Ke,10/14/2021,Laura,"Ashley had already read Mark 12, so we had some really sweet fellowship on some of the verses that stood out to her. She had some questions about the retreat, but is very excited to be coming this weekend!"
10/15/2021,Elena Su,10/15/2021,Laura,Chatted for a bit about movies. Then we read Mark 13 together - how do we know what the Spirit is speaking? we need to be in the Word. She wants to come again LD morning.

Also talked about the retreat msg 1 with him, about the need to advance from Egypt to the wilderness to the good land and what does it mean for us to be in spirit."
10/20/2021,Jean Billa,10/14/2021,David,"He had some questions about marriage, fornication, and relationships so we had some good fellowship over that. He has a heart to be a proper testimony to some of his friends who are going a different way in these matters."

10/20/2021,Daniel Lee,10/19/2021,David,"Ate a late lunch together then walked to campus and read and fellowshipped over ch 4 of ""The Economy of God."" He said it's good to be reminded that we should not be distracted by trying to do good from enjoying Christ and feels that he's made some progress on this but his girlfriend still struggles, hopefully he'll share with her. Also mentioned that it was really nice to read together again since we hadn't read in a while."
10/20/2021,Luc Picard,10/20/2021,"David, Tim","Read and fellowshipped over Luke 1. Talked about how a lack of faith will cause us to be dumb (like with Zachariah), faith coming from our living contact with the Lord and His word. If we're not in this living contact we won't have much to say concerning the Lord. Then we brought out the example of Mary's pray-reading and said that our interaction with the Lord's word should be to believe and exercise faith to pray back what He has said. Asked for his favorite verse which was Matt 5:16 and used that as an example. We shouldn't pray over the word promising to carry out the requirement but instead ask that the word would be fulfilled in us. Every verse in the NT is impossible but no word is impossible with God."
10/20/2021,Juan Aleman,10/18/2021,"Marc, Tim","We caught up and spoke about what he's been up to and future plans. We eventually got to speak about the retreat and some things we enjoyed.

At the end, Sophia made a comment about how she feels like she needs to spend some more time with the Lord to have conversations with Him as she's making these big decisions regarding post-grad plans but she's just so tired when she wakes up in the morning. We just talked about just talking to the Lord throughout the day - it doesn't have to just be in the morning."
10/20/2021,Omar Orozco,10/20/2021,David,"Met up and went to Oath since he hadn't eaten all day. Chatted and talked about how we can talk to the Lord about anything and treat Him as our best friend. Omar said recently he had only been sharing his joys with the Lord but closing up a bit when he was feeling down. I encouraged him that we can learn the secret of rejoicing in the Lord at all times whether we are ""abounding"" or ""being abased"" by our talking to him all the time and praying over the word."
10/21/2021,Delight Nweneka,10/21/2021,"Katy, Rachel, Laura","Small group Bible study with Delight and Grace to go through Romans 4 (Delight listened in while finishing up some work). Explained how Abraham is the father of both the Jews and Gentiles through faith. Grace said that sometimes she feels like she doesn’t deserve grace, especially when it comes to studying for exams. Both Delight and Grace are stressed out about classes and midterms, but we were able to pray for them after. Grace also invited a friend, Yohan, who just stayed for lunch."

10/24/2021,Shulammite Lim,10/21/2021,Laura,"got lunch and talked more about post-grad plans.

10/26/2021,Junang Li,10/21/2021,"Marc, Tim","We started with a casual conversation on what he's doing and what his future plans were.

He liked the illustration! & we prayed along those lines."

Also touched upon the woman pouring out her alabaster flask on the Lord and how we should take care of loving the Lord and there will spontaneously be a fragrance of our loving Him. Ended by praying over a point from the chapter that we enjoyed."
10/27/2021,Jean Billa,10/27/2021,David,"Caught up and then had some fellowship over the Bible study. Focused mainly on the third point of not trying to fulfill the law but rather focusing on our romance with the Lord. Jean said he had never considered this before and enjoyed it. His prayer at the end was very good, asking the Lord to woo him and cause him to love him more."

We need the Lord's healing to see the heavenly things. Then we had a lot of fellowship concerning the proper interpretation of the kingdom of God being likened to a mustard seed growing into a great tree and the woman hiding leaven in fine flour. Through fellowship he received the interpretation of the great tree being a negative thing and not a positive thing. Ended with some prayer. (Also found out that his mom is a MIT professor and has founded two companies)"
11/4/2021,Omar Orozco,11/03/2021,David,Caught up for a bit and he told me that even though he hasn't been getting much sleep recently he has been praying and speaking to the Lord a lot throughout his days in the past weeks and it's caused him to be full of peace and joy. He said he's been doing really well despite his workload. We then read and fellowshipped over Phil 1 mainly about how through the supply of the Spirit every situation can turn out to salvation. Paul could rejoice in prison and we can have real joy and peace in our circumstances when we allow Christ to live in us and receive the filling of the Spirit. Just encouraged him to keep practicing to speak to the Lord all the time and to read the word as much as he could find opportunity to do so. Ended with prayer.
11/4/2021,Jean Billa,11/03/2021,David,"Caught up and he asked me how we should include the Lord in our planning for the future. Had some good fellowship about making plans but not holding onto or insisting on them, instead just opening to anything the Lord would do to adjust or redirect. Then read and fellowshipped over Isa 55 concerning how the Lord's thoughts and ways are higher than ours."
11/4/2021,Jonas Cameron,11/04/2021,"David, Tim","Read ch 5 of ""The Divine Economy"" on the river of water of life. Had a lot of rich fellowship on how God Himself is an eternal dispensing and so His desire and plan matches His character. He wants to flow and dispense Himself into us. God flowed into the Son who became the Spirit so that He could get into us and fill us. This fountain, spring, and flow is now installed in our spirit and is seeking to fill our heart and soul, so our turning to Him and opening to Him is the practicality of God's economy. God is always flowing but is our heart turned and open. Ended with prayer."
11/4/2021,Delight Nweneka,11/04/2021,"Laura, Katy, Rachel","Group Bible Study (Shulammite joined too). Spent some time to catch up - Delight is looking forward to IPMM (she loves singing with everyone). Read Romans 6 and talked a bit about what it means to walk in newness of life, and sanctification. Ended with prayer for each other."
11/4/2021,Ethan Harbaugh,11/04/2021,David,Read and fellowshipped over Luke 14. Talked about how all things are ready and we just need to come to the feast! We may have a lot of excuses but the Lord's desire is for us to just come and feast. Also very much appreciated something that Ethan shared concerning not desiring the seat of honor. He said it is our nature to be self seeking and self centered and there is no way for us to change. We can only allow the Lord with His divine nature to spread from our spirit to our soul!
11/9/2021,Spencer Yoder,11/09/2021,"David, Tim",Read and fellowshipped over the Bible study material on developing our personal and intimate relationship with the Lord. Emphasized very much how each one of us needs to know the Lord and love him in a personal and affectionate way. Also brought out how our formal and traditional prayers don't leave us feeling nourished or supplied and how pray-reading helps us to really touch the Lord. Ended with some prayer and Spencer prayed that the Lord's love would be better than anything in the world to him.
11/9/2021,Daniel Lee,11/09/2021,David,"Got dinner together and then read ch 6 of ""The Economy of God"" on the inward parts and hidden parts. Daniel was very impressed by the parts of the spirit and felt that though he felt his intuition was normal he needed to strengthen the exercise of fellowship and conscience. He was also impressed that Brother Lee could bring out so many verses concerning the parts of man especially from obscure places in the Bible without having access to a searchable Bible."
11/10/2021,Diana Renteria,11/10/2021,"Laura, Katy",Got lunch and talked about our families and siblings. Just had a sweet and normal time together. She's planning on coming to IPMM!
11/11/2021,Dominic Maggio,11/10/2021,David,"Had a short 30min time together, sat with him while he ate and just chatted about his life and things going on with us. Ended the time by sharing with him the story of Zaccheus and the dynamic saving power of God for about 5min before he had to run to his next thing. He also told me he's going to Tony and Anna's for Thanksgiving!"
11/11/2021,Luc Picard,11/10/2021,"David, Tim, Sam",Read and fellowshipped over Luke 19. He was wondering what the parable of the slaves and minas meant so we had some fellowship on what our capital is (Christ) and what it means to do business. Then we shared about the contrast between the young rich ruler in and Zaccheus in Luke 18 and 19. Ended with some prayer over some verses that touched us.
11/11/2021,Jabes Gallardo,11/11/2021,David,"Had a zoom call and caught up. Then read and fellowshipped over Luke 20. He asked what death is in the Bible and so I shared with him Eph 2:1, 5, Matt 10:28, and most importantly Rom 8:2. We ended up having a lot of good fellowship over the contrast between the law of the Spirit of life and the law of sin and death. He really enjoyed the gravity vs the airplane picture. Ended with some prayer. I proposed having morning revival together twice a week in addition to our weekly appointments and he was very excited to do it. We're planning to do 15min calls on Mondays and Wednesdays."
11/12/2021,Ashley Ke,11/12/2021,Laura,"read Luke 10 together (she's behind but I just felt to jump in where she is) - it was so sweet. She asked about what was going on in vv.38-42 and we had some sweet fellowship about ""choosing the good part"" and being open to the Lord and to His Word. Then, we talked about the story of the good Samaritan and she felt she's not very kind or selfless naturally. But, we were just enjoying that actually we need the Lord to come and find us and heal us first. She's looking forward to IPMM tomorrow :-)"
11/14/2021,Elena Su,11/14/2021,Laura,got coffee before the Lord's Table. Read Luke 22 together - had some sweet fellowship about Peter's (and our experience of) denying the Lord and repenting.

11/16/2021,Debbie Zhuang,11/16/2021,"Laura, Katy, Rachel","Continued our reading in the Life Study of Genesis and fellowshipped about needing to offer our experiences of Christ to God in the middle of difficult situations.  We prayed for her friend, Chris, whom she has been speaking to and has invited to Bible study.  "
11/16/2021,Sophia Fang,11/16/2021,Laura,"read HWMR, had some sweet fellowship about being filled essentially and economically with the Spirit. She said the reading reminded her of Hymns #448 - we had some fellowship about ""walking with the Lord in the light of His Word"" and on ""your heart, does the Spirit control?""."
11/16/2021,Shulammite Lim,11/16/2021,Lisa,"After giving the Bible study intro yesterday, Shulammite realized that she and Sophia haven’t had as much time together this semester. We prayed for this. Also prayed for the shepherding of Gina and her going on."
11/17/2021,Diana Renteria,11/17/2021,"Laura, Katy","met up for lunch - talked a little about companions and our families, but mostly just caught up and had a normal time together. "

11/17/2021,Luc Picard,11/17/2021,"David, Tim, Sam","Chatted for a while and then read John 1. Fellowshipped over how John's gospel is a book focused on life bringing out 1:4, 12-13. In Him was life and we received Him by believing and that caused us to be begotten as children of God. Then shared with him concerning baptism and he mentioned that he had been thinking about it since Elena's baptism. Encouraged him to pray and seek the Lord concerning baptism."
11/18/2021,Delight Nweneka,11/18/2021,"Katy, Rachel","Had a very sweet and mutual time in Romans 7!  Fellowshipped about how we cannot be perfect no matter how much we try, and that merely being good does not come up to God's standard (Job).  We need the Spirit and a relationship with God!"
11/18/2021,Vivian Chinoda,11/17/2021,"Katy, Rachel ",Our time was very normal and sweet with her. Spoke about our families and her experience of God speaking to her about choosing a major. Gave her a care package. Invited her and Victory to our Friendsgiving dinner. She will let me know if she can make it. 
11/18/2021,Clay Davis,11/18/2021,David,First appointment! He's been struggling with physics but also very busy with crew though he's enjoying crew a lot. Asked him if he's been having any kind of regular prayer and he said he doesn't know what to say even if he did try to pray. I told him he can just talk to the Lord like a friend but if you don't have anything to say you can pick any section in the New Testament and just read until you feel like you can talk to God with one of the verses. Then read John 2:1-11 and shared about the wine running out but the Lord changing death into life.
11/18/2021,Elena Su,11/18/2021,Laura,Elena came over to bake pies for Friendsgiving tomorrow! ❤️Just spent time together. Then we read John 2 - had some fellowship about how only the Lord really satisfies. She hung out at my house for a little while things were in the oven working on psets.
11/18/2021,Diana Renteria,11/18/2021,Lisa,Continued reading The Normal Christian Faith. Then we prayed together. Diana wanted to pray for some things she’s going through as well as for her dad’s work situation.
11/21/2021,Elena Su,11/21/2021,Laura,grabbed coffee together before the LD meeting. Talked a little bit about John 4:13-14 - thirsting again and drinking the living water.
11/21/2021,Jabes Gallardo,11/21/2021,David,"Had a long fellowship but some brief highlights
- Fellowshipped about how testifying and witnessing comes from an overflow of enjoying the Lord, ""Come and see!""
- The gospel of John is a book of life, Jesus came not only to accomplish redemption but to give us life, we must grow in the divine life by eating and drinking the word through prayer
- Jabes said previously he had thought the Bible was used to improve our human life but says that he is realizing there is something important, the growth of the divine life through our contact with the word"
11/21/2021,Daniel Lee,11/17/2021,David,Grabbed dinner and had some brief fellowship about the bookends of the Bible. Read footnote 1 on Gen 2:25 and shared about how the tree of life is the center of God's plan and purpose. He was impressed that our focus as Christians is not to try and figure out how to serve God but to eat the tree of life. He's been trying to see how his PhD research can be of use to God and humanity.
11/21/2021,Ethan Harbaugh,11/18/2021,David,"Read and fellowshipped over John 2. Ethan was impressed that the vessels at the wedding needed to be filled with wine, the Spirit! Then I pointed out that in a chapter about life and being filled with the Spirit the Lord talks about the real temple. Life is for building. He pointed out that our involvement with God in anyway should be for the Lord's purpose of building the church. Ended by connecting it to my Bible reading in Chronicles and how even David's sin and God's forgiveness produced Solomon for the building of the temple. He was quite struck by that because he didn't know that Solomon was the son of Bath-sheba."
11/21/2021,Jean Billa,11/18/2021,David,He was feeling a little guilty about unplugging digitally over the previous weekend to study and not responding to friends' texts and asked me if he was being selfish by putting schoolwork before social interactions and being available. Had some really good fellowship about how we can't take care of everyone and that there will always be someone in need (including ourselves). The only way we can know whether we are being selfish or not is by seeking the Lord's presence and smile as we decide what to do and who to care for (again including ourselves). The governing factor of whether we should do a certain thing or not is whether or not we have the Lord's presence and smile.
11/30/2021,Shulammite Lim,11/23/2021,"Katy, Rachel",Grabbed a quick lunch with Shulammite with a cake for her birthday. Also gave Grace and Delight care packages and talked about Thanksgiving plans. They were all very cherished! Grace and Delight requested prayers for their internship interviews.

11/30/2021,Sophia Fang,11/30/2021,Laura,"she asked: ""how do you minister Christ to someone when you yourself aren't in a very good condition? On the one hand, it's 'he who waters will be watered himself', but on the other, we need to be the first to enjoy the Lord and be filled"".  Had some sweet fellowship about some verses in Song of Songs and our experience. Then, we got into the HWMR together."
11/30/2021,Junang Li,11/30/2021,"Sam, Tim",Covered A Righteous Forgiveness. Fellowshipped on repentance and its relationship to God’s forgiveness. He is traveling to Princeton this week and will be in an interview.
12/1/2021,Daniel Lee,11/30/2021,David,Got dinner together and chatted about our Thanksgiving breaks. Shared with him about the Bible study about becoming the New Jerusalem by being transformed by the Lord.

He shared about being more at peace recently and resting in the Lord with regards to his research and work.
12/1/2021,Dominic Maggio,12/01/2021,David,Caught up and talked about Thanksgiving break and winter break plans. He'll he here for a class. At the end shared with him a few verses from John 13 about loving one another so that the world would know that we are disciples of the Lord.
12/1/2021,Garrett Robinson,12/01/2021,"David, Sam",Chatted for a while and then got into the Bible study on the New Jerusalem. Emphasized how the destination of the Christian life is a marriage so the journey must be one of developing our love for the Lord. He brought out that to reach the goal of the Bible we must take the narrow way. Also encouraged him to pray over the Song of Songs which he says he avoids because he thinks it's only for people wanting to get married haha. Told him that praying over Song of Song helps us in our romance with the Lord and he appreciated that viewpoint.
12/1/2021,Luc Picard,12/01/2021,"David, Tim, Sam","Reviewed Bible study briefly and then jumped into John 13. Had a lot of fellowship concerning what foot washing really is and what it means to experience it today, both washing one another's feet and having our feet washed by the Lord personally."
12/2/2021,"Delight, Grace ",12/02/2021,"Katy, Rachel ","We read Romans 8. Shared with them that the main function of the law of Spirit of life is to shape the development of the divine life in us. Ultimately, this law will shape us to be the exact duplication of the firstborn Son of God. Also, how all things involve all matters, all event, all things to work for good and how this good is not related to our gain of physical matters but it refers to our gaining Christ. We ended our time with praying for one another."

12/5/2021,Jonas Cameron,12/02/2021,"David, Tim","Continued our reading of ""The Divine Economy"" reading a chapter concerning the Son's incarnation with the Father and  His ministry by the Spirit. We were all very impressed that when we touch the Lord we get all three of the Godhead. God embodied in Christ can now be our all. Jonas shared that just as the Lord lived with the Father and in constant fellowship with the Father we today must desire and aspire to live in constant fellowship with the Lord."
12/5/2021,Jacob Rodriguez,12/02/2021,"David, Sam",Just had a casual time to catch up and chat.

Lord release such a normal and sweet time.
12/5/2021,Ethan Harbaugh,12/02/2021,David,"Read and fellowshipped over John 14, Ethan really appreciated that the Lord is the reality or the truth. He mentioned that taking philosophy classes at community college caused him to realize how comforting it is that God is truth. Also shared with him about knowing in our experience that we are in God and that God is in us, the mutual abode should be real to us in our experience."
12/7/2021,Spencer Yoder,12/07/2021,"David, Tim","Caught up with him and asked about his Thanksgiving and other things (ROTC, flying, IAP and summer plans).

We finished by practicing to pray whatever we read back to the Lord!"
12/7/2021,Debbie Zhuang,12/07/2021,"Laura, Katy",finished LS Gen msg 32 - we were just really impressed that we are covenanted people and that there is a verse of promise to meet every situation.
12/7/2021,Elena Su,12/07/2021,Laura,"went for a walk and got to hear a little of how much she enjoyed the IPMM. Super casual time, but made plans to get together often during Winter Break/IAP (to try as many coffee shops as we can haha)"
12/13/2021,Elena Su,12/12/2021,Laura,coffee before the meeting - read Acts 1 together
12/13/2021,Luc Picard,12/08/2021,"David, Tim, Sam","Awesome appointment reading John 19, inoculated a bit by fellowshipping over why the Jews wanted to crucify Jesus. Then had some more fellowship over the water and the blood from the Lord's side and being saved much more in His life. Finally connected it to the building of the church and preparing the bride."
12/13/2021,Daniel Lee,12/07/2021,David,Grabbed dinner together and shared a bit with him from our fellowship in the morning about finances and trusting the Lord/choosing Him.

12/13/2021,Jonas Cameron,12/09/2021,"David, Marc","Continued our reading of ""The Divine Economy"" and read about the all-inclusive death of Christ.

12/16/2021,Luc Picard,12/15/2021,David,"Read Acts 4 and has some good fellowship concerning having boldness to speak for the Lord. This boldness comes from the Spirit filling us inwardly until we overflow and become clothed with the Spirit. Then also shared about how the saints in the early church would spontaneously quote the word in their prayer and would according to and with the words of the Bible. This should be our practice today, our prayer should be soaked with the word and we should absorb the word in our prayer and echo the word in our prayer. He shared concerning how even though he doesn't always feel like he absorbs very much when he reads the Bible he discovers later that something got in and that he is able to pray more with the words of the Bible spontaneously later."
12/16/2021,Jonas Cameron,12/15/2021,David,Continued our reading of “The Divine Economy.” Ch8 was on the surpassing resurrection of Christ and we had a lot of good fellowship on what it means to experience resurrection today. Shared on Phil 3:10 on how Christ first died and the resurrected but today we first experience the power of His resurrection so we are able to be conformed to His death. Jonas shared concerning the difficulty of living Christ constantly and how often he lives himself. Shared with him how the power of resurrection is mentioned in Eph 3:16-17 concerning Christ making His home in our heart. Every time we find ourselves living out ourselves instead of Christ is an opportunity to open to the Lord and allow Him to make His home in us. Ended with some good prayer.
12/16/2021,Jacob Rodriguez,12/15/2021,David,Had a very long talk about authority in the world and in the church and how a typical Christian should behave himself in relation to people in authority and what true submission is. This led to some fellowship about what it truly means to help people. Was able to share how only Christ living in us can truly take care of people but also that only a community of people living Christ can truly meet the needs of people. Ended with some prayer which was quite good. Jacob prayed for Christ to fill him and that people would know Christ through him.
1/11/2022,Luc Picard,01/11/2021,David,Read and fellowshipped over Acts 26 (on Zoom T_T). Had a lot of good fellowship about what it means to see a heavenly vision and what it means to live by it. Luc shared how it is impossible to unveil ourselves and how we need the Lord to reveal Himself to us as He did to Paul. I shared a bit of my enjoyment concerning Hannah's prayer and offering our cooperation to the Lord. Ended by praying over Acts 26:18 and by praying to consecrate the new semester and ourselves to the Lord.
1/12/2022,Daniel Kim,01/12/2022,David,"Read and fellowshipped over Acts 26, shared with him the importance of living our Christian lives with a vision and goals just as he does his secular and academic life. Daniel said he feels it's hard to set goals in the Christian life since it's not as tangible or quantifiable as secular things. Had some good fellowship on what it looks like to set goals in our Christian life based on 26:18. Ended with prayer."
1/12/2022,Dominic Maggio,01/12/2022,David,Caught up and chatted for a long time about what we did over the break and the current covid situation.

1/12/2022,Ethan Harbaugh,01/12/2022,David,Read Acts 28 and had some really good fellowship on how Paul was a person who proclaimed the word and the gospel regardless of his situation and circumstance. Shared 2 Tim 4:2 with him and how being ready in season and out of season is really a result of our living and work being no longer distinct. Ended with some really good prayer asking the Lord to help us establish good spiritual habits in the new year and semester.
1/13/2022,Spencer Yoder,01/13/2022,David,"Read and fellowshipped over Romans 1 about the gospel being power of God and the structure of the gospel, ""The righteous shall have life and live by faith."""

1/13/2022,Adun Obisesan,01/13/2022,Laura,"with Cassia - on a call for almost 2 hrs. It was SO good to catch up (Adun is working, still remotely from Ohio). Her and Cassia have started memorizing the book of Ephesians and they recited the first 7 verses together! Then, we read the last 3 sections of chapter 2 in ""The Glorious Church"". We just had some sweet fellowship and were refreshed by God's original goal is to have the church - purely out of Christ and filled with Christ!"

1/29/2022,Elena Su,01/27/2022,Laura,"she came to my house to bake brownies for the homemeeting and then we went to CfA for dinner. She shared with me one of her goals for 2022 is to be more in the Word. It was really encouraging - she said, ""it's really hard for me to read before I go to bed, usually I'm so tired, I just skip it, so I decided to start reading earlier in the day"""
1/29/2022,Adun Obisesan,01/29/2022,Laura,with Cassia. Recited verses from memorizing Eph 1 and continued reading chapter 3 of the Glorious Church. Very sweet time with some precious fellowship about the washing of the rhema word.

2/9/2022,Luc Picard,02/07/2021,David,"He attended a big Catholic conference over the weekend so I asked about that, his main take away was that he needs others to grow closer to the Lord and to see more of the Lord! Then I overflowed a bit from the IPMM and we fellowshipped over 1 Cor 6:17. I tried to emphasize the importance of being one spirit with the Lord but may not have done the best job. Lord give us more opportunities to speak about the mingled spirit with Luc!"

Spoke much about how we need oil not only in our spirit but also in our soul which he appreciated. It was also interesting to hear him talk about the punishment of the believers. He said something about believers being cast into eternal fire and how faith without works is dead. I'm not sure if he thinks he can lose his salvation or if he has some strange understanding of reward and punishment. We may need to follow up on this.
2/9/2022,Ethan Harbaugh,02/09/2021,David,Talked about life and learned that he turned down an invitation to attend a big EMT conference to go to retreat! Read and fellowshipped over 1 Cor 8 and Ethan has a burden that Christians should be willing to sacrifice (not eat meat) for others benefit.

We mainly fellowshipped over Lev 1 because he's trying to read the first chapter of every book of the Bible right now. We had some really good fellowship on how absoluteness makes God happy and only Christ lives absolutely for God. Now we can lay our hands on him!

Ashley is SUPER excited for the retreat!"
2/12/2022,Adun Obisesan,02/10/2022,Laura,"with Cassia - continued reading in ch 3 of ""the Glorious Church"". We were focusing on the church being the kingdom for the expression of Christ.

2/15/2022,Jonas Cameron,02/15/2022,"David, Callum","Reading ch9 of ""The Divine Economy"" on Christ becoming the life-giving Spirit. We ended up having some very rich fellowship on saying amen to what the word says even if we don't fully understand it and the importance of enjoying and experience the fact that Christ is now the life-giving Spirit. It seems like Jonas received it (previously he had not been so receptive to this thought). In his prayer he had one line in which he said, ""Thank You Lord for becoming the Spirit."""
2/15/2022,Luc Picard,02/15/2022,"David, Caleb","Read and fellowshipped over 1 Cor 13 and 14:1-4.

Then I asked him why Paul says we should desire the gift of prophecy over all other gifts. Had a lot of fellowship about being worried of speaking inaccurately or misleading people and how we can only improve at prophesying by practicing. I proposed we call Saturday nights to prepare something for Lord's Day which he was open to!"
2/16/2022,Jean Billa,02/16/2022,David,"Jean was pretty all over the place today but we had some good fellowship concerning Christ being the rock that follows us and also concerning the Lord's responses to the devil's temptations in Matt 4.

Explained how we can experience the Lord's death and resurrection today in our daily life by conversing with Him and opening to Him in the moments when we sense we are not one with the Lord either in our thoughts, feelings, or decisions. This causes the life of God, the zoe life to be manifested not only in an individual way but also in a corporate way."
2/24/2022,Ethan Harbaugh,02/23/2022,"David, Caleb","With Nosa from Harvard!

Then we just had some fellowship about the 3 parts of man and that we contact the Lord in our spirit. Lastly, I shared with her the example about how when our house is on fire, praying doesn't always work - we need to call out! Calling on Jesus is calling on the One who saves us out of our situation, our anxiety, etc. 
(She is VERY excited about IPMM at MIT this Sat!)"

She shared with me her experiences with Intervarsity lately and how the Lord is leading her after graduation to be a worship leader at a megachurch in Texas.

Kailyn was touched that she wants to build up a habit of spending more time with the Lord in the morning and in the Word."

12/1/2022,Kailyn Gustafson,11/30/2022,"Adrian, Frances","We read Colossians 3 and enjoyed the matter of seeking the things which are above, where Christ is. Kailyn brought out that we need to put on the new man, inward parts of compassion, and love."
12/1/2022,Kailyn Gustafson,11/30/2022,"Adrian, Frances","Kind of sweet bc Kailyn is always the one to transition us to the Word! We enjoyed Colossians 3 and talked about setting our minds on the things above in our daily lives and all that distracts us. When we were fellowshipping about how to do this, Kailyn actually brought up that she needs to do this more often, but one way is to call out the name of the Lord!"
12/1/2022,Faith Odunsi,12/01/2022,"Frances, Genesis","We read 1 Timothy 5 and talked about how the believers are our family and setting our hope on God and continuing in petitions and prayers. Faith asked about verse 18 (""For the Scripture says, “You shall not muzzle an ox that is treading out [the grain,]” and, “The workman is worthy of his pay.””), so we talked about verse 17, laboring on the word, and read a portion in 1 Corinthians 9."

We had good fellowship about ways to enjoy the Lord. Brenda likes to listen to gospel music and pull up the lyrics to look at alongside. We all prayed at the end. At first she didn’t know what to say, but using one of the prayers she prayed a very genuine prayer opening to the Lord to enjoy Him! We also told her about the spring break trip and she wants to come!!! Oh Lord, release her to come!"
12/8/2022,Elena Su,12/08/2022,Laura,"started to read, but she stopped to ask a question about the difference between disciples and apostles. Led to question after question about the pope, difference between Catholicism and Protestant, do we confess our sins to a priest, what if we don't agree with what the Bible is saying, modesty, feelings of guilt, does the Lord really understand why we commit sins since He's sinless, what really is sin, etc. Anyway, I was just so so happy that she was able to bring all these things up and that we could talk about them.

5/4/2023,Ethan Harbaugh,05/04/2023,"David, Victor","Continued our reading of Life and Building as Portrayed in the Song of Songs. Had some great fellowship over our need to eat, digest, and assimilate Christ!"
5/4/2023,Garrett Robinson,05/03/2023,"David, Jeremy",Continued our reading of Life and Building as Portrayed in the Song of Songs. Had some fellowship on what it means to experience the death and resurrection of Christ in a daily way. Garrett also shared with us from his enjoyment in Psa 119!
5/8/2023,Remi Kuba,05/08/2023,"Adrian, Grace","So sweet! We finished John 3. Remi liked v.30 about Him increasing “bc [we are] vessels”. We talked about eternal life and how this life is a Person that wants to be expressed and lived out through us. When we spend time with Him, He increases in us and becomes all of our endurance and goodness, etc. Also talked about how all Scripture is God-breathed. Remi resonated with the fact that it’s not just letters on a page like her textbook. May the Lord keep growing in her week by week! Ps side note she said she learned in Latin that Lucifer means light-bearer lol"
5/9/2023,Brenda Chow,05/09/2023,"Adrian, Louisa",Went over Bible study last night on the overcomers. Brenda was touched that the Lord loved us with the first love so we should also love Him in that way. We also had some fellowship about the blood of Christ and how it brings us back to God. Pray that the Lord would give her the experiences she needs to go on as a Christian! She wrote down the four prayers given last night. May she pray them back to the Lord. 
5/22/2023,Remi Kuba,05/15/2023,"Adrian, Grace","Read John 4:1-24. Remi remembered this chapter from last semester’s Bible study. She said that worldly things don’t satiate us, but drinking the Spirit satisfies us! We talked about v.14 and how we have a fountain installed in us always, whenever we need. Remi said we can also be fountains to others! We encouraged her to keep drinking the Spirit by talking to the Lord and calling on Him."
5/22/2023,Faith Odunsi,05/15/2023,"Adrian, Grace",Great to see her again! We caught up from all the way before spring break. Faith will be in Nigeria during the summer for an internship. 
5/22/2023,Brenda Chow,05/16/2023,"Adrian, Louisa","Brenda saw the high peak! We went over the morning revival on being reconstituted with the word. After reading, she spontaneously said, “if we spend more time with God and in His word, we will become like Him.” We had some good fellowship on how the word can change us. Encouraged her to continue pursuing over the summer (she said she will join the YP meetings in Chino Hills!) and she also signed up for the John Bible reading challenge. "
5/22/2023,Remi Kuba,05/22/2023,Adrian,"We finished John 4. Before we read, Remi prayed that we would not just read but get it into us and get life. Had some really good fellowship about being satiated — not only are we satisfied and happy when we read the word and sing/pray, etc, but the Lord is also satisfied! Talked about us being vessels to be filled with God and live Him out. We also talked a bit more about the blood of Christ since she didn’t know what that was on Friday. She was really touched by the dirty rags. At the end, Remi prayed that He would make His word our food and that He would keep satiating us! Lord, keep feeding Remi!"
9/4/2023,Noah Yared,08/28/2023,"Smith, Victor",Met at Massee dorm then walked to get Toscani's ice cream together (very yummy); read Col. 1 together and were impressed with Col. 1:18; maybe share on 1:17 next time (cohere)?
9/4/2023,Noah Yared,09/04/2023,"Smith, Victor","Met with Noah for the second time. He's been rushing some fraternities but isn't sure if he will join. We read the HWMR together, week 5 day 1, and talked about what does it mean that Jesus was highly exalted? Noah prayed for experiences of Christ's name and to grow in personal relationship with Him."
9/19/2023,Remi Kuba,09/11/2023,Adrian,"Read John 5. We talked about how religion is doing things for God without Christ and Remi mentioned that she saw that in the way the Jews were. She pointed out v.44 and how it’s not glory to ourselves. I asked her what she thought it meant to give glory to God and she said “Doing normal daily things but with the Lord.” She had mentioned how she doesn’t like school, so we talked about how doing things with the Lord gives things meaning."
9/19/2023,Brenda Chow,09/12/2023,"Adrian, Louisa","We didn’t get to cover anything today because she had to go, but she mentioned that she is trying to read the entire Bible from Genesis to Revelation! She started in August and plans to finish around 8/12/24."
9/19/2023,Candace Ramirez,09/13/2023,Adrian,"Awesome time! We talked a little about her experience at MIT so far and heard a little bit about her testimony with the Lord growing up. She had an experience where she was really sad and opened up the Bible where there was a verse that said “do not be anxious.” We talked about talking to the Lord as a Friend throughout the day and brought up her human spirit! Candace told me about Sadie Robertson and how she goes throughout her day in continuous prayer. This is possible bc the Lord is our heavenly ladder and He has made the way for us! We have our human spirit to contact Him! We ALSO talked about how the Lord is the reality of every positive thing. Candace seemed to grasp that the great things the Lord gives us are not just things like our family, but they are Himself as the reality of all these things! "
9/19/2023,Remi Kuba,09/18/2023,"Adrian, Jessi",Read half of John 6. We had really good fellowship about the Lord being the true bread that came down out of heaven. Also talked about how sometimes we can be in a stormy situation but we can be willing to let the Lord into our boat.
9/19/2023,Brenda Chow,09/19/2023,"Adrian, Louisa",Got into the first chapter of God’s need and God’s goal. Brenda said that it makes sense that God’s salvation needs sinners. We got to tell her that God’s need is for her to express Him at MIT! He needs someone like her who is in the Bible every day and constantly talking to Him that can make Him known. 
9/19/2023,Ashley Ke,09/19/2023,Adrian,"We read the chapter of the day, Matthew 16, and she was touched that without God, every day life is meaningless. We talked about how God wants us to know Him and how the retreats and college trainings are a great way for the Lord to speak something to us. We also talked about making God our goal and being full-time in our serving Him even when we are working, and Ashley prayed that He would be our goal even while we’re working."
9/20/2023,Shea Khyeam,09/20/2023,"Louisa, Jessi",We all shared our testimonies and talked about our experiences of the Lord drawing us. We talked about the active passive relationship we have with the lord. Were gonna meet together in 2 weeks

9/21/2023,Dora Zhou,09/21/2023,Adrian ,"Got to hear a bit about how she’s liking MIT (she likes it, classes are easy for her). We read John 1 and were impressed that John the Baptist was one that led people to Jesus and wasn’t unwilling to let his disciples go. At the end, Dora prayed that we would be like John and let the Lord be our center!"
9/26/2023,Remi Kuba,09/25/2023,"Adrian, Jessi","Awesome!! We read more of John 6 and Remi was confused about the verse “no one comes to Me unless My Father draws him…” We talked about spending time with the Lord and getting drawn by Him! We encouraged her to set even just two min a day to be with Him. Lord, draw Remi!"
9/26/2023,Brenda Chow,09/26/2023,"Adrian, Louisa","Read half of the second chapter of GNGG. Seemed like nothing really got in. Brenda comprehends with her mind what it means that our need corresponds to God’s need, but she didn’t seem to care. She did seem touched that we could live our whole lives being good yet not be for God. She brought up even going to meetings but not living for the Lord. We might transition back to getting into the word with Brenda just to feed her as it seems like that’s all we can do for her now. "
9/26/2023,Zakiya Smith,09/26/2023,Adrian,"She got saved!!!! Met at Flour and got to know more about her family and her time at MIT so far. She grew up Christian, but said she was kind of discovering her faith and not sure what to believe in. Then we started the book of John and had some fellowship about grace and reality coming through Jesus and how He became the life-giving Spirit to fulfill all the demands of the law in us. She prayed to receive the Lord!! She was really excited and asked for tips and tricks to bring a Christian. She’s not sure she wants to be baptized yet, but I encouraged her to read her Bible to grow in life and talk to God in her daily life. She was super excited! Thank You Lord for Zakiya! Lord, grow in her! "
9/27/2023,Candace Ramirez,09/27/2023,"Adrian, Johanna",Read up to John 2:18 and had some good fellowship about the waterpots and how the joys of this world will fade away. We are vessels made to contain God. We asked Candace how we contain God and she said by spending time with Him! We talked about how it helps to have a set time.
9/27/2023,Jolie Duquene,09/27/2023,Adrian,"Read 1 Peter. Jolie liked the verse on the proving of our faith which is much more precious than gold. We talked about how we go through various trials but we can gain something more precious than gold during these times by talking to the Lord! Had some fellowship about our human spirit and Jolie said it was “so cool.” At the end, she thanked the Lord for our faith that is more precious than gold."
9/28/2023,Ashley Ke,09/28/2023,Adrian,"Read first chapter of GNGG. Ashley was impressed that often she’s just focused on her need and forgets about the Lord’s need. We had some good fellowship about realizing that our salvation is not just for ourselves but God has a much higher purpose for us. She brought up the church and God’s building and how God needs people for this, and we talked about how we need to grow in order to match Him and go to the meetings not for our need and satisfaction, but for Him. "
10/3/2023,Remi Kuba,10/02/2023,"Adrian, Jessi","Finished John 6. We brought out “to whom shall we go? You have words of eternal life” and had some good fellowship on the word and specific times the Lord has spoken to us. Remi said that the verse in Phillipians about in nothing be anxious was real to her. We talked about telling our anxieties to the Lord. Encourage her to talk to her teacher to let her come to retreat. Lord, release her for retreat!"
10/3/2023,Brenda Chow,10/03/2023,"Adrian, Louisa",🥴. Didn’t have much time so we pulled out the Bible study material and tried to lead Brenda to pray-read. She seemed very closed and distracted. 
10/3/2023,Ashley Ke,10/03/2023,Adrian,"Awesome!! We had some good fellowship about consecration and how important it is for the Lord’s satisfaction. Had some great prayer at the end where Ashley gave herself, her life, and today to the Lord. She really likes this book. She wants to give more time to the Lord during her free time this year."
10/4/2023,Candace Ramirez,10/04/2023,Adrian,Read up to John 3:21. Had some fellowship about the Lord being the way instead of our good person (Nicodemus) and Candace prayed that we would realize the Lord is the solution and turn to Him more! We also talked about eternal vs everlasting life and appreciated what a wonderful life we have in us.
10/4/2023,Jolie Duquene,10/04/2023,Adrian,Really sweet! We read 1 Peter 2 and Jolie was really impressed by the word being milk to us to help us grow. She also liked that we are living stones for the spiritual building and we talked a bit about the corporate aspect of being a believer. She prayed that the word would be milk to us and that we grow in life! I think she has really been tasting that the Lord is good in the word!
10/5/2023,Zakiya Smith,10/05/2023,Adrian,"Zakiya signed up for retreat!! She said her first week as a Christian has been really good! Whenever she is in a stressful situation she has been trying to pray and turn to God. She said it helped her get through the week. We had a sweet time finishing John 1 and reading John 2. Had some good fellowship about reading the Bible (she’s been reading a few verses of Matthew every day!) and how to pray short prayers over the word. Lord, keep growing in Zakiya!"
10/9/2023,Remi Kuba,10/09/2023,Adrian,Read John 7 and prayed about an exam she’s anxious about. Remi prayed that we would keep coming to Him in hard times and good times.
10/10/2023,Kayla Zethelyn,10/10/2023,Adrian,"Interesting. Got to hear more about her background (her parents were Buddhists but converted to Christianity). Kayla has been wondering whether Christianity is for her or is just her parent’s religion. She couldn’t pinpoint her time of salvation (said it was gradual, through experience) so we prayed together. I’m not sure if she fully believed, because she seems to be in her mind a lot about the Lord. She wants to grow and “crave the Lord” more, but seems to be hindered by her thoughts.  Anyways, pray the Lord would be real to Kayla! Lord, give her a definite and real touch with You! "
10/11/2023,Candace Ramirez,10/11/2023,Adrian,Really sweet! Finished John 3 and talked about us being the bride of Christ and telling the Lord we love Him. Then we continued up to John 4:24 and Candace was really impressed that God is Spirit so He’s not focused on merely the human things that we might do to try to worship Him. We enjoyed that we need to be in our spirit to worship Him the way He wants!
10/11/2023,Jolie Duquene,10/11/2023,Adrian,"Finished 1 Peter 3. Jolie enjoyed the hidden man of the heart and the meek and quiet spirit. We talked about how it’s possible to have all these great virtues mentioned in this chapter, by being “in Christ” by contacting Him. We also talked about what true blessing is, to gain God! Jolie prayed at the end that He would grow more in us today."
10/12/2023,Ashley Ke,10/12/2023,Adrian,"We had a really sweet time. Talked for a while about opening to the Lord, especially in difficult situations, in the context of reconciling difficult things that happen to good people. Then we read half of ch. 3 of GNGG and Ashley was touched that we can have a more thorough consecration where we offer not just ourselves, but our children (example in the book), showing that it touches every aspect of our life. We talked about how our consecration comes from our love, so consecration is sweet and it’s a joy and rest to give everything to Him. Our prayer at the end was really sweet, about wanting to give ourselves to the Lord in a deeper way. Lord, gain this deeper, thorough consecration in Ashley!"
10/12/2023,Zakiya Smith,10/12/2023,Adrian,"Read John 3. She really liked v.16 and we got to talk about into vs in and how when we are joined to the Lord in this way, we can experience this eternal life. Zakiya enjoyed that eternal is not just in length, but also the “fullness”. She has been faithfully reading from Matthew, and she is on chapter 3 now! Encouraged her to have a time with the Lord in the morning and she is excited to try. She feels more comfortable with her knowledge of the word now and wants to come to Bible study!"
10/16/2023,Jovani,10/16/2023,"Smith, Victor","Jovani likes tae kwon do, fever grass tea, and doesnt like meat too much. We read Mark 15. We asked two main questions: who crucified Jesus, and why did God allow Jesus to die? Jovani said God wanted to Jesus to die for His purpose. We discussed with Jovani the fact that we all have a sinful nature that envies and is prideful. Later we brought out that God tore the veil of sin that separated us from God, and we can now come forward by prayer"
10/18/2023,Daniel Kim,10/18/2023,"Smith, Victor","We finished resding ch. 1 of The Meaning and Purpose of Prayer. Daniel was very impressed with the matter of inquiring of the Lord, to pray what is on the Lord’s heart, rather than asking for things. This is very relevant to him as he’s considering what to do next summer and this IAP so he wants to practice asking the Lord and praying with the Bible."
10/19/2023,Viveca and Veloria,10/19/2023,Jessi Louisa,It went great!! We talked about our spirit with diagram and How the Lord became the spirit. We also brought up the bible study and Viveca especially enjoyed it! Shared that they should bring this matter of baptism to the Lord. Lord release their baptisms!!!
10/19/2023,Brenda Chow,10/17/2023,"Adrian, Louisa","Just talked to her, wanted her to just enjoy the time."
10/19/2023,Ashley Ke,10/17/2023,Adrian,Finished ch. 3 of GNGG. We talked about the difference between simply entrusting ourselves to the Lord versus handing ourselves over and Ashley recognized that it’s hard to completely hand ourselves over to the Lord. Shared a little about “No mortal tongue” and how there is such freedom when we hand ourselves over fully. Prayer at the end was sweet!
10/19/2023,Jolie Duquene,10/18/2023,Adrian,"Got to talk to her about baptism! She seems very positive and willing to be baptized at retreat. Lord, do it! We also read 1 Pet. 4 and enjoyed v.10 about being stewards of the varied grace. We can share this grace with others and we each have our own portion. We talked a bit about running against the dissoluteness, and Jolie prayed that we wouldn’t go the same way as everyone else and something about fellowshipping with the Lord but also with one another."
10/19/2023,Cassia Wang,10/19/2023,Adrian,"Prayed for the students and the campus. Cassia wants to have someone to talk to about the Lord. Lord, arrange someone for Cassia to talk to! "
10/23/2023,Jovani,10/23/2023,Smith,"Jovani does not like outdoorsy things too much because dirt and sand is a bit irritating; also there’s a lot of scary things in the world (jellyfish, giant squids, snails). He is content with seeing pictures of them from his room, which led to some fellowship concerning faith. Read Luke 6 and talked about prayer being contact with God, not just asking for things, and how that can be the source of our considerations and decisions. Lord, infuse Jovani with faith!"
10/24/2023,Andrew Yuan,10/24/2023,Victor,We read the chapter of the day and talked about faith. Andrew was impressed with the faith of the centurion who asked just for a word from the Lord. We also talked about the Lord coming to the widow in verse 11 and raising her son without her even asking. We prayed that the Lord increase our faith
10/25/2023,Remi Kuba,10/23/2023,"Adrian, Jessi",Read up to John 8:36. Talked about being set free through the word. Remi prayed that we would be set free from our anxieties. May Remi have an experience personally of the Lord being her peace!
10/25/2023,Ashley Ke,10/24/2023,Adrian,Read half of GNGG ch. 4. Enjoyed that we can have new beginnings every day and that the Lord is our beginning. We talked about how sweet it is to enjoy the Lord in the morning before we start our day. It’s always sweet to pray with Ashley! She prayed that the Lord would draw us more.
10/25/2023,Candace Ramirez,10/25/2023,Adrian,"Candace liked the retreat! We finished John 4 and enjoyed v.42 about these things becoming our experience instead of just others telling us about the Lord. I asked her if she feels like God has become more real to her during her time here and she mentioned that she really likes that she’s more involved in church things, but she’s been struggling finding a balance and putting the Lord first. We talked a bit about seeking the Lord first and how giving our time to Him is pleasing to Him. She enjoyed from the retreat how we might not be able to set aside a whole hour to pray but we can call on the Lord in the midst of our days, like during our exams."
10/26/2023,Jolie Duquene,10/26/2023,Adrian,"Sweet! Got to eat lunch with her and her parents and she was really excited to invite them on Friday night. Then we left her parents and I asked about how she enjoyed retreat. She loved the singing and sessions. She didn’t remember much, but said she took a lot of notes she can go back to look at. We read ch. 5 of 1 Peter and talked about how we can shepherd one another. We can guide each other to the food! Inoculated her a bit about the enemy being a roaring lion, his lies and how we need to learn to follow the sense of life in us. Oh Lord, keep Jolie enjoying! Really appreciated her prayer at the end about the word becoming our food and asking the Lord to help us find the little nuggets in it."
10/26/2023,Zakiya Smith,10/26/2023,Adrian,"Read up to John 4:24. Zakiya has been struggling with some doubts about the Bible. We got to talk a bit about using our spirit and not needing to comprehend all of the Bible at once. She recognized that it’s the enemy coming in to try and make her doubt. Tried to encourage her just to get one word or one verse from each chapter instead of trying to understand it all. Oh Lord, keep her in life! Bind the enemy!"
11/1/2023,Jovani,10/30/2023,"Victor, Smith","Talked about his food interests—doesn’t like to try new things or things with too complex of flavors. Went over Luke 13, and the fellowshipped about the bent double woman and the distraction/slavery of the world. We were able to insert a little inoculating word based on religion’s opposition to the Lord’s speaking and move based on v. 14! Very encouraging prayer from Jovani at the end concerning the Lord’s death and resurrection and how He came to serve us!"
11/1/2023,Jolie Duquene,11/01/2023,Adrian,So sweet! We read 2 Peter 1 and had some fellowship about partaking of God’s nature and then enjoying the word. Jolie remembered that Christ is the Morning Star so we enjoyed that every morning He can rise up as the Morning Star in our hearts! Jolie shared that in her time in the word in the morning she’s been trying to go back and find something she enjoyed to pray over. We prayed that the word would be sweet and enjoyable to us!
11/7/2023,Wasim Pysadee,11/07/2023,"Ray, Victor",We read about God creating man in His own image and talked about what Gods image is. Wasim said it’s His character. We talked about some of His characteristics like love and light. Wasim said God made us with the sense of good and bad. We also read about God creating man as a vessel to contain Him. Wasim asked why we were created. He said man is just created to worship God. Does God really need man? What is God’s plan? We prayed that God would cause us to pursue Him and love Him more
11/7/2023,Remi Kuba,11/07/2023,"Adrian, Jessi",Remi seems anxious and drawn about by all the busyness of classes and midterms. We finished John 8 and got to fellowship about her human spirit and that being the way to experience the Lord. Remi says she has been trying to spend time with the Lord in the morning but it’s hard because she’s tired. Still burdened she would have real experiences of the Lord and even the Lord would have a way amidst her busyness.
11/7/2023,Brenda Chow,11/07/2023,"Adrian, Louisa",Read Luke 21. She had to go right after we finished.
11/7/2023,Ashley Ke,11/07/2023,Adrian,Read a little more of GNGG ch. 4. Talked about redeeming each day and making it count by involving the Lord. Ashley enjoyed that the Lord has done everything and that we just have to come to Him. We prayed that we would keep opening to the Lord and that we would experience Him!
11/7/2023,Mena,11/07/2023,Jessi louisa ,We read 2 Thes 2.  We talked about receiving a love of the truth. She asked us if we thought Christ is the spirit. We ended up sharing a little bit on the TG and the duality of the truth. This cleared up her concern about thinking we were modalist. At the end she was so happy!
11/8/2023,Candace Ramirez,11/08/2023,Adrian,"So good! We talked for a while and I got to share some of my experiences in college with her. Then we read John 5 and enjoyed the story of the man waiting for the stirring of the water and how it’s the Lord who heals us! Got to inoculate her a bit about how those who follow the Lord will be persecuted and slandered and how it’s often because of religious jealousy. We also enjoyed v.39-40 about coming to Him to receive life instead of just coming to the dead letter. At the end, Candace prayed that we would focus on the eternal life and not just a happy human life."
11/9/2023,Veloria Pannell,11/09/2023,Jessi Louisa,Read over the chapter of the day. This lead us to talk about consecration. We all prayed after consecration ourselves to the Lord and encouraged her if the Lord is leading her to have a time to consecrate to the Lord.  
11/14/2023,Mena,11/14/2023,Louisa Jessi ,"She had just finished a midterm that was tough so when she showed up she was pretty distracted. During our appointment Zakiya walked by and said Hi to us and to Mena. And they talked a little bit about ice skating! Afterwards we read 2 thes 3 and based off vs 15 talked about being reconciled with our brothers and having God’s feeling for the other believers. During the time we both had a feeling to inoculate Mena, but when we kinda tired to mention it, it didnt feel like the time."
11/15/2023,Daniel Kim,11/15/2023,"Smith, Victor",I told Daniel my testimony and he asked about the church in Merced so I took the opportunity to inoculate him about Witness Lee. We read about the best praying being one in which God is expressed. Daniel said it’s not possible to wholly contain the vision of the knowledge of God. We then talked about Paul receiving a vision of Jesus Christ and prayed that the Lord would shine
11/15/2023,Brenda Chow,11/14/2023,"Adrian, Louisa",Read half of John 4.
11/15/2023,Candace Ramirez,11/15/2023,"Adrian, Jessi","Read up to John 6:56. We enjoyed that the little boy brought his portion of five loaves and two fish and the Lord was able to bless and feed so many! We also enjoyed that to live out the Lord we need to eat Him. Candace agreed that when she spent a lot of time studying without eating she couldn’t study properly. In the same way, we need spiritual food to live out the Lord! Lord, give Candace this bread always! She thanked the Lord that the He is renewing us every day. She also joined in to pray before we read (which she has never done before) so that was sweet."
11/15/2023,Jolie Duquene,11/15/2023,Adrian,"Finished 2 Peter. We talked about expecting and hastening the Lord’s coming by our living, how much we include the Lord in our day. Jolie enjoyed the verse that we would be found in peace without spot and blemish when He comes. Had some fellowship about our conscience and how we should exercise always to be at peace with God and man. We actually talked about baptism again. Jolie was touched by this guy’s baptism at Central Sq Church where he said he used to just study and never really experienced being loved but then he met the Lord and experienced love. She seemed touched by the prayer “we love You, Lord” and prayed it again at the end. Anyways it’s super complicated bc she doesn’t have that much time at home and she has to be a member to be baptized etc. but may the Lord release her baptism with us this LD!"
11/16/2023,Veloria Pannell,11/16/2023,Jessi louisa ,We read through the chapter of the day. First talked letting the Lord into our situations and that outwardly nothing changes but we have the Lords presence. She mentioed that she was stressed about school and opened to Lord. So we shared that sometimes the lord wants to gain us in our situations heal our being/give us His thoughts. Then we got to inoculate her!! Watchman Nee ✅ Witness Lee ✅ Cult ✅ We were wrong ✅ People being offended ✅ Toxic speaking ✅ She left saying this time was sooo sweet!!!

11/16/2023,Ashley Ke,11/16/2023,Adrian,"We read half of ch. 5 GNGG. Had some sweet fellowship about our Christian life and human life not being a straight line but the ups and downs helping us to gain Christ. Ashley prayed something touching at the end: “thank You Lord for the downs so we can gain You and the ups so we can enjoy You!” Told her about WN and WL (and the persecution) under the premise of telling her about the author of GNGG and she said thank you for the history lesson lol. Talked about how I appreciate this author because I feel like it really helps me love the Lord more and she agreed that this book has helped her grow more instead of just being like a sermon. Lord, keep growing in Ashley!"
11/17/2023,Ethan Harbaugh,11/17/2023,Victor,“Thank You Lord that we are in You as You are in the Father.” -Ethan (in spanish) 
11/21/2023,Remi Kuba,11/21/2023,"Adrian, Jessi","Got into John 9 with Remi up until v.34. We talked about what it meant for us for the Lord to cause the blind man to be able to see. Talked about the Lord’s speaking and word making us clear and how we can ask the Lord for certain experiences. We segwayed to baptism and tried to impress her with the importance of baptism. She seems open, but wants to get baptized at home in Hawaii. Lord, release Remi’s baptism!"
11/21/2023,Tigest,11/21/2023,Adrian,"Met up with her for dinner in Maseeh. Tigest grew up as a Christian, loving the Lord and talking to Him about everything as a kid. As she got to high school, she began to be stumbled by the mega church she attended and its hypocrisy. She turned away from the Lord and drowned herself in YouTube and other entertainment. At some point, she picked up God Has a Wonderful Plan For Your Life by Ray Comfort and was struck deeply by how sinful she was despite thinking she was good. After that encounter, she wanted to know God and is now currently attempting to read the entire Old Testament (she’s in 2 Kings). Tigest seems open and her experience of the Lord is very sweet. May the Lord release more times to get into the word with Tigest!"
11/30/2023,Viveca and Veloria,11/30/2023,Louisa,We read the chapter of the day. Vivica and veloria both brought up their extended family who are unbelievers and wanted to pray for them. So we talked about household salvation and prayed for their dad. I brought up Jolie’s baptism and it seemed like maybe Vivica has a little bit of feeling to be baptized. Also got to inoculate Vivica about watchman Nee and witness Lee and being persecuted. It was really sweet and they were both so happy we could pray for their family. Vivica was tearing up 🥹. Veloria prayed Lord open their eyes and reach them as the flow of living water. 
12/7/2023,Cassia Wang,11/30/2023,Adrian,Prayed for Jolie and her baptism. 
12/7/2023,Jolie Duquene,11/30/2023,Adrian,Got into 1 John 1! We enjoyed the cycle of life and Jolie asked how she can prepare for her baptism.
12/7/2023,Remi Kuba,12/04/2023,Adrian,"Read John 10. Was attempting to inoculate her and talking about persecution but out of it Remi had a genuine question of how we can know the Lord’s voice. Was sweet, we talked about how we can ask the Lord about little things in our life and learn His voice. Lord, appear to Remi! She would hear Your voice personally!"
12/7/2023,Ashley Ke,12/05/2023,Adrian,"Finished ch. 5 of GNGG. We had sweet fellowship about the Lord allowing us to fall so He can expose our heart and cause us to grow. Tried to infuse her with the importance  of God’s goal, the church. She had the realization from previous chapters that we’re not just here for our need but to build the church. I don’t think she’s exactly clear on what God wants yet. May the Lord continue to reveal His heart to Ashley!!"
12/7/2023,Tigest,12/05/2023,Adrian,Met up at McCormick. We had some good fellowship about not having conference/retreat highs. Told her about spending time with the Lord and in the word. Talked about calling on the name of the Lord and how it can turn us back to the Lord all day long! Tigest has started reading the Gospel of Luke recently. 
12/7/2023,Cassia Wang,12/07/2023,Adrian,"Had some sweet fellowship about spending time with the Lord in the mornings and in the word. Lord, keep Cassia touching You!"
12/7/2023,Jolie Duquene,12/07/2023,Adrian,"Jolie said that since her baptism the world has been “different but not different”. I encouraged her to consecrate herself to the Lord at this precious time. We read 1 John 2 and had some fellowship on abiding in the Lord and the anointing. The more we’re with Him, the more we live Him out! Jolie has been faithful to pray and read in the mornings. May the Lord continue to really gain her!"
12/12/2023,Brenda Chow,12/12/2023,Adrian,Really sweet! We talked about what she wants to do together next semester. She told me about the church she goes to here and back in California and what they are covering. We had some sweet fellowship about Solomon and Ecclesiastes and the Song of Songs. We will read Hebrews next semester! 
12/12/2023,Ashley Ke,12/12/2023,Adrian,"Read first half of GNGG ch. 6. It’s about failure again lol so we kind of reviewed what we had talked about before and spoke about not being complacent like the older son. Then we talked about baptism and Ashley wants to get baptized next semester before she graduates! Lord, do it!!"
12/17/2023,Zakiya Smith,12/14/2023,Adrian,"I felt bad that I didn’t get her a Christmas present and she said “it’s ok, you gave me Christ!” 🥹 Read up to John 6:51 and enjoyed that our work is just to believe Him and contact Him! Also talked about letting the Lord into our boat in every situation."
12/17/2023,Tigest,12/14/2023,Adrian,"We started John 1! Were originally going to read Acts but she just finished Luke. She has a friend who’s going through very difficult things so she was trying to read the Gospels to get an idea of how the Lord was practically when He was on earth. Encouraged her to just be filled with the Lord so she can minister Christ to her friend. Got up to John 1:28. Told her about her spirit and how the Lord wants to spread into our soul! Tigest seems to enjoy the ministry terms. She said she’s always wondered what sanctifying means practically. We had some good prayer at the end. Lord, keep spreading in Tigest!"
